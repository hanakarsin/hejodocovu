However, added that the new union would have negative effects on students.</p><p>He said, ‘‘CONUA has always been in OAU and yet the school is on strike. The association has a lot of work to do to build their relevance and it is going to take years, not anytime soon.’’</p><p>Remember that Naija News reported earlier that the president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), prof.
