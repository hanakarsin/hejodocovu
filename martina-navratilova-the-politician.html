Gwyneth has to decide to cut ties with Martina in order to help advance Payton's political career, but her cameo is equal parts chic and unforgettable.</p><p>"Really enjoyed getting an acting job between Slams this year," Martina wrote on her website. "Out now on Netflix — hope you enjoy it :)" Her appearance on The Politician has many fans wondering whether the chemistry between Martina and Gwyneth is in any way real.</p><p>And while Gwyneth is famously married to Brad Falchuk, who created and executive produced The Politician alongside Ryan Murphy, Martina is actually married to former Miss USSR beauty pageant star Julia Lemigova, who also came in second place as 1991's Miss Universe.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Yesterday walking the red carpet with my wife for the premiere of #thepolitician @julialemigova :), can you say GLAM? @loreerodkin</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Martina Navratilova</a> (@martinanavratilova) on Sep 27, 2019 at 11:22am PDT</p></figure><p>After a relatively public proposal at the 2014 US Open, the women left their residence in Florida to marry three months later in New York, where same-sex marriage was legal at the time. "We went to New York and then had a celebration party on Valentine's day," Julia said in an interview with U.K.'s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorraine</a>.</p><p>"It's an amazing feeling," she said, admitting that she "was overwhelmed and completely surprised" at the proposal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Martina is an outspoken activist and breast cancer survivor.</h2><p>Before landing her role on The Politician, the tennis magazine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseline</a> notes that the athlete has played herself on-screen, on a 2000 episode of Will & Grace, a 2013 episode of Portlandia, and even in a minor role in the 2017 Chinese action film, The Adventurers.</p><p>But on social media, Martina is an extremely vocal critic of President Donald Trump and uses the platform to sound off on her political and sports views to her almost 300,000 followers. "I am surprised that more players have not come out," she told BBC about her decision to be public about her marriage to a woman.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>"They're so far in the closet that I don't even know who they are," she continued. "The fear is still there. Sport has been at the forefront on so many issues, but it's not been great on the gay rights issue."&nbsp;</p><p>Martina is also a breast cancer survivor and is vocal about how the struggle with illness changed her perception on life.</p><p>"Being a top-level athlete, you learn to be positive," she said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>. "So that came in very handy as a patient, being a positive person ... and surround[ing] yourself with positive people as well. However much money you make, you can make more, you can make less. Time ... that's something you can never have back. Don't feel guilty about doing what's good for you."</p><p>Watch the incredible tennis star Martina Navratilova appear opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in The Politician, now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zwMinmGamkau%2FosDIpaavmV2ptaZ5z6ijoqyZmLaiug%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./52355-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;Nigeria To Sell Oil Refineries In 2014,&amp;quot; - Petroleum Minister</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./astrology.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leos | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
