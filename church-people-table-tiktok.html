And it seems like there are others who can corroborate this experience with some less-than-ideal customer interactions of their own.</p><p>Like this one posted about by another user on the platform by the name of Shanell (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@spotlightshanell</a>) who encountered a large group of customers who kept adding more diners to their table and exhibited generally inconsiderate behavior the entire time. To top it all off, Shanell worried that she wouldn't be getting a tip when they were finally done.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@spotlightshanell href=#>@spotlightshanell</a><p>and got the nerve to be impatientâ€¦.I need them to get THE FCKKKK ðŸ˜­ <a title=spotlightshanell href=#>#spotlightshanell</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=serverlife href=#>#serverlife</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Spotlight Shanell ðŸ’•" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Spotlight Shanell ðŸ’•</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>She says in the video: "Right now I have a table...full of church people they bout to send me to hell. God please, god please, god please, first they say it's gonna be thirteen, they get here and they like oh we got five more. So now they want us to pull five more seats out of our a**. And this is my first table of the day. It's 6:39 they're just getting their food."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>The exasperated server continued, explaining the delay it took in getting their meals to the table: "Why? Because everybody didn't get here till like f***ing six o clock...the people who was here already was probably like ten people they don't want to get started until everybody is set. We telling them we might be able to set all y'all at the same time because your set-up was thirteen now y'all saying it's eighteen, nineteen, they keep adding people to the f***ing party."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>The frustrations with the "church crowd" table didn't end there: "It's only me taking this whole f***ing party I'm sitting here waiting for them, waiting for them, waiting for everybody to get set I keep going to the table asking them are y'all ready? Are y'all ready? No, we're waiting for our friends. We're waiting for these people we're waiting for that people."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>What makes matters more delicate, the server says, is the age range of the customers: "It's a bunch of old people y'all so I'm trying to be so patient with them, but baby..." she just puts her hand on her forehead and laughs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>Shanell goes on to say that the table of elderly church folks then begin to take a turn, "Then they all finally got set y'all and they got the nerve to be rushing me. Then they're adding people one by one, they're pulling chairs from other tables, add 'em to their table, like, if these people don't tip me..." she begins to laugh again while shaking her head.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>"Then, I don't know if she the first lady but got the nerve to be rushing me and I'm asking her like what you want to order she like, 'give me a minute'." Shanell then looks into the camera in utter disbelief at how much situational awareness the customer lacked. "A minute? I done gave y'all sixty-seven of them! I've been waiting for y'all for over an hour what are you talking about a minute?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>Shanell finished her rant, looks at the camera, and then begins to walk out of the kitchen while speaking into her camera while moving her finger around in circles. "Let's go ahead and wrap it up!" she says as she walks out into the dining area to interact with her massive table of churchgoers once more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spotlightshanell</span></figure><p>The video then cuts to Shanell talking into the camera again however at a different angle, "They really on my last nerve like I just want to get up and get out like if they don't tip me, y'all, after all this...aite, aite."</p><p>She did provide an update to how much she was tipped in a follow-up. And true to "church people" form...this is what she received.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@spotlightshanell href=#>@spotlightshanell</a><p>Replying to @user9334915292224 broâ€¦ im finna quit.

How would you have reacted? Do you think that the restaurant should've added an automatic gratuity for table sizes that large? Or do you think that gratuities should always be based on an "honor system" from customers?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLW2vsKhZKmdn6W5pnnTmpmlnV2ptqzAzqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./we-are-breeding-future-p0rn-stars-i-go-dye-cries-out.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>We Are Breeding Future P0rn Stars I Go Dye Cries Out</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-bell-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Drake Bell - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
