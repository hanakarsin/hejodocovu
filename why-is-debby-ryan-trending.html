But why is Debby Ryan trending on TikTok all of a sudden?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>From her controversial Netflix series to her engagement news, Disney Channel alum <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Debby Ryan</a> has made quite a few headlines in the past. But now, the actress is popping up on everyone's social feeds for an entirely different reason. &nbsp;</p><p>You may have noticed a few throwback clips or random memes about the actress's smile, which have now become part of a viral trend on social media. But how did this all start? And what did Debby have to say about this? Read on to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Channel</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why Is Debby Ryan trending on TikTok?</h2><p>In short, countless users have taken to the social platform to poke fun at Debby's unique mannerisms and facial expressions. For example, users have taken clips of the actress dramatically storming off or walking away in certain scenes. Then, they added clips of their own hilarious impressions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ryandiary101 href=#>@ryandiary101</a><p>NOTICE ME DEBBYðŸ˜­ <a title=neverfitin href=#>##neverfitin</a> <a title=jamsession href=#>##jamsession</a> <a title=debbyryan href=#>##debbyryan</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - nahitsemily" href=#>â™¬ original sound - nahitsemily</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Scenes were taken from a variety of her past works, ranging from Jessie and 16 Wishes to Netflix's Insatiable. But her strut wasn't the only thing that fans poked fun at. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@boclarkeee href=#>@boclarkeee</a><p>I am radio rebel <a title=radiorebel href=#>##radiorebel</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=debbyryan href=#>##debbyryan</a></p><a title="â™¬ Lost by frank ocean - jaylenrowee" href=#>â™¬ Lost by frank ocean - jaylenrowee</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Fans also recreated her "shy girl" smile from the movie Radio Rebel, where she played a podcast DJ named Tara Adams. One particular scene that's been grabbing users' attention is when Debby awkwardly peers up at her crush, Gavin. While some simply copied her smile, others went as far as using the face warping filter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@slimeybiscuit.soccergirl href=#>@slimeybiscuit.soccergirl</a><p>oh debster <a title=madisonbeer href=#>##madisonbeer</a> <a title=debbyryan href=#>##debbyryan</a> <a title=radiorebel href=#>##radiorebel</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - nahitsemily" href=#>â™¬ original sound - nahitsemily</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Debby Ryan impressions also started trending on Twitter.</h2><p>Tweeters have also joined in on the fun by pointing out her unique smile, comparing her to popular fictional characters and famous stars. For instance, one user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked</a> that "Debby Ryan is the Halsey of acting."</p><p>But perhaps the most popular saying is that the 26-year-old "smiles in cursive."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>debby ryan smiles in cursive, but walks in comic sans. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kTFdFEmqlD</a></p>â€” uwu(à¹‘ï½¥Ì‘â—¡ï½¥Ì‘à¹‘) (@tiffanynngo) <a href=#>April 30, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">People have called her out for not closing her mouth when she smiles.</h2><p>Well clearly, these fans have no chill. Aside from the imitation videos, users have also been pointing out that Debby seemingly can't close her mouth completely when she smiles on the red carpet. In fact, many have uploaded press photos, where her front teeth are still visible when she's smirking.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did this Debby Ryan trend start?</h2><p>TikTok user @peppermintflower was reportedly the first to post a video on April 29, 2020, which now has over 933,000 likes. She shared a short scene of Debby smirking in Radio Rebel and then imitated her smile.</p><p>It was enough to spark an entire trend because other fans were suddenly inspired to do the same. Several impression videos have already garnered millions of views and likes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Debby respond to all the memes?</h2><p>It sounds like the actress is completely unbothered. Rather than trying to shut down these memes, she joined in on the fun by poking fun at herself. On Twitter, she shared a fan's tweet where he imitated her smile. Then, she posted a GIF of the cartoon character Roxanne, where she shyly smiles and flips her hair. Debby <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>: "I was serious about my craft from a young age and studied technique alongside Roxanne from A Goofy Movie."&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps she'll surprise fans with a fun meme of her own on TikTok, but for now, it looks like the star is keeping busy with her own projects. Though Insatiable unfortunately ended after two seasons, the star currently has a podcast called There You Are with Debby Ryan, where she sits down with people in the film industry to have open and honest discussions. She will also be starring in Netflix's upcoming thriller, Night Teeth.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ2dkpfGbr7YmqVmrKKau6W1zaA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./427585-ziara-ya-samia-suluhu-kwenye-umoja-wa-mataifa-yaleta-matumaini-mapya-kwa-diplomasia-na-diaspora-ya-tanzania-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ziara ya Samia Suluhu kwenye Umoja wa Mataifa yaleta matumaini mapya kwa diplomasia na diaspora ya T</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./obvious-plant-revengers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>This Guy Trolled Shoppers With Bootleg 'Avengers' Toys And They're Hilarious</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
