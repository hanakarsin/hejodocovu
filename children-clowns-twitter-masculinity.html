What's messed up is when parents try to force certain kids to play with certain things because of their gender.</p><p>From a young age, boys are often expected to play with guns and trucks, while girls are expected to play with dolls and play ovens. And while these stereotypes are less common than they used to be, they're still enforced every day. Twitter user S. S.
