However, problems persisted well into Tuesday morning, with the "Robinhood Help" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a> confirming at 11:35 a.m. that service had only been partially restored.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Twenty minutes later, the company tweeted that the app was fully functioning again, but the damage had already been done. "I <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lost $12K</a>. Can you feed my kids?" one angry customer commented. Another added, "I want the money that I lost. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Not an apology</a>."</p><p>In response to the backlash, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TechCrunch</a> reported that Robinhood "will offer compensation for yesterday’s outage on a case-by-case basis." The company issued a statement following the first round of technical difficulties, writing, "We want to assure you that your funds are safe and personal information was not affected."</p><p>They also acknowledged, "When it comes to your money, issues like this are not acceptable. We realize we let you down, and our team is committed to improving your experience."</p><p>A DevOps engineer offered some insight into what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">might have happened</a> on the app’s backend to cause such a mess. "Robinhood either doesn’t have proper disaster recovery, deployment rollback, or capacity planning," he speculated.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"Let me guess. Robinhood is also single tenant on [Amazon Web Services]? Anyone who knows how to run a large service at scale would see this as pure incompetence," he added.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Over 1,500 users have signed a petition to ban Robinhood from FINRA.</h2><p>In less than 24 hours, a group of outraged customers set out to build a case against Robinhood "for their negligence and late open" on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>"Due to the loose playing startup negligence of Robinhood, users have lost money, missed massive gains, and other market opportunities," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a petition</a> aiming to halt the app from any financial securities activity stated. The document also alleges that some users have threatened suicide due to damages incurred during the blackout.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: change.org</span></figure><p>A Twitter page calling for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">class action lawsuit</a> against the California-based company already has over 6,000 followers, many of whom claim to be out large sums of money due to their inability to trade on March 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Late Monday, the owner of the account alleged that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the system crashed</a> because Robinhood "didn’t code for leap year." The page even made a reference to the literary and cinematic character the company is named after.&nbsp;</p><p>"Robinhood is literally robbing the good," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a tweet</a> from Tuesday reads. "Everyone was making moves and the Wall Street suits cashed in while we were stuck on the sidelines."</p><p>The fallout from this is only just beginning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrp5Keu6m7zp1kmqig</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-sedaris-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Sedaris - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./super-siah-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Super Siah - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
