Angeles&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;California-based YouTuber and comedian Anthony Padilla is no tough name when it comes to YouTube business.&nbsp;Not only is he well known for his animations he made in the early 2000s, but he is also a good writer and producer.&nbsp;Here in this article, you will find out interesting facts about the talented young staff of YouTube, their professional and personal life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Anthony Padilla Biography, Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Originally born as Daniel Anthony Padilla on September 16, 1987, Padilla grew up with his parents and two brothers in Sacramento County, California, United States.&nbsp;Anthony’s father Dan Padilla and mother Leezah Padilla separated when he was two years old and so he was raised by his mother.&nbsp;He does, however, visit his father alongside his brother on weekends.</span></p><p><span>Anthony attended Del Campo High School in FairOaks and after graduation he moved to American River College in Sacramento, California, but dropped out of school two years later because he was diagnosed with Henoch- SchonleinPurpura (HSP).&nbsp;He then decided to keep himself busy by learning to code and from there he created a site he called Smosh through which he could connect with his friends without going there.&nbsp;Smosh was created in 2002. The name, according to Anthony, was taken from an incident where he confused a friend’s explanation of a mosh pit with a “smosh pit”.&nbsp;At the time of its creation, Smosh was a site where several flash animations were made.&nbsp;His childhood friend, Ian Andrew Hecox, later joined him to post several videos and,&nbsp;in 2005, the site became one of the most popular and visited sites.&nbsp;Basically, the channel grew with over 30,000 subscribers, apart from his close friends who used it.</span></p><p><span>Anthony Padilla’s popularity has skyrocketed after he posted a video of himself and his friend Ian lip-syncing to the Power Rangers song.&nbsp;The song was so admired that it was shared by her followers.&nbsp;Gradually, his Smosh video found its way to YouTube, which was then a new website.&nbsp;With approximately 24 million views, Anthony’s Smosh video became the most viewed video on the YouTube channel at the time.&nbsp;After creating their Smosh YouTube channel in 2006, Padilla and his friend started branching out.&nbsp;They started out by creating short YouTube skits such as&nbsp;</span><span>That Damn Neighbor and the Food Fight,</span><span>their annual video series.&nbsp;YouTube also offered him the chance to be part of its first wave of advertising program.&nbsp;He revamped the channel in 2009, adding additional videos and a games section.&nbsp;The following year he launched 3 different web series based on Smosh:&nbsp;</span><span>Ian Is Bored which was later renamed Smosh Is Bored, Ask Charlie</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Lunch with Smosh.&nbsp;</span><span>From there, their major move to stardom began as they both launched more channels which not only made them more popular but also earned them a decent amount of money.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>The successful growth of Anthony Padilla’s Smosh YouTube channel has contributed to his recent accumulation of wealth.&nbsp;According to most websites, Anthony has an estimated net worth of $8 million.&nbsp;This was accumulated over the total of 7 YouTube channels he co-owned.&nbsp;He created 3 channels in 2012 and they are named&nbsp;</span><span>ElSmosh</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Shut up!&nbsp;Cartoons&nbsp;</span><span>and Smosh Games.&nbsp;In February</span><span>&nbsp;2014, Smosh already has a mobile application where all of its videos and other content can be accessed.&nbsp;Anthony and his friend have also released an Xbox One app and many more.</span></p><p><span>Not only has he been successful in his YouTube business, he has also been recognized by many prominent corporations and businesses.&nbsp;He even won many awards such as YouTube Comedy Awards 2006, Social Star Awards 2013, 4th Streamy Awards and Webby Awards 2016. Anthony has released several comedy music albums through Smosh.&nbsp;They include&nbsp;</span><span>Sexy Album</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>If the Music Was Real</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Smoshtastic</span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span>The Sweet Sound of Smosh.&nbsp;</span><span>Meanwhile, on June 14, 2017, Anthony Padilla announced in a YouTube video titled&nbsp;</span><span>Anthony</span><span>&nbsp;Leaving Smosh that he had officially left Smosh.&nbsp;Before his announced departure, he created&nbsp;</span><span>Anthony Padilla 2</span><span>, where he would download videos as much as he wants.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Anthony Padilla Wife, Girlfriend, Is He Gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Although his rise to fame is often his skills in creating comedy videos, it is not wrong to say that Anthony Padilla is a handsome and cute young man with thick luscious hair that makes him a sensation among the ladies. .&nbsp;Some even assumed him to be gay but, Anthony is not gay, in fact, he has an interesting relationship.&nbsp;He was first engaged to Kalel Cullen in 2013, but they broke up shortly after their relationship began.&nbsp;He claimed the American personality was “manipulative” and “toxic” during their relationship.&nbsp;He was also in a relationship with Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram but in September 2017, he announced that he was in a relationship with a popular YouTube star and actress, Miel Bredouw, better known as Mielmonster.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>Anthony is 5 feet 11 inches tall and he has an athletic body weighing 160 lbs (72.6 kg).&nbsp;He also has a pair of brown eyes with his chest, waist, and biceps measuring 40, 30, and 14 inches respectively.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiuoqOZZL2mu8%2BlnGiZnqm1sLrYZqeanJmhuaJ51qKdnmWXnr%2BtstGinKecXZa0pnnHnqCgoKRiu6bAjLCmq6yYYra0eceeZKCZqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./402110-baringo-mois-ally-gladys-tungo-distributes-wheelbarrows-carwash-machines-100-groups-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Baringo: Moi's ally Gladys Tungo distributes wheelbarrows, carwash machines to over 100 groups</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-siri-saying-2020-ends-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Siri Saying 2020 Ends Today?
