Kelly later said that the cocaine accusations greatly affected her daughter, Jolie, and that she and Vicki could never become friends again as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>Vicki, on her part, said she wasn't exactly sure why she wasn't asked back on the show full-time, but that she understands that the franchise tries to keep things fresh by adding new cast members every year or so. Braunwyn Windham-Burke joined the show in Season 14 as Vicki's "replacement." The possibility of Vicki leaving permanently resulted after the reunion wrapped filming on Nov. 8.</p><p>Vicki celebrated the reunion's end by grabbing dinner with her fiancé, Steve Lodge.</p><p>In a series of Instagram stories, which were grabbed by OK! Magazine, Vicki captioned one of the stories with words that are now being dissected by fans.</p><p>“It’s a wrap," she wrote. "Season 14 reunion done. Now onto my new projects. Thanks [Steve Lodge] for being my rock.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some are thinking that Vicki's sentiment that she's moving on to other ventures means that she might finally be done with the franchise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Vicki also hasn't been holding back on the comments section of her Instagram page. Under a video she shared from her glam process before the reunion, one fan said that Season 14 lost the original focus of the show, which centered around families, career women, and friendship.</p><p>"I couldn’t agree with you more," Vicki responded.</p><p>Another fan urged Vicki to be done with the show because she was above her castmates. The fan also said that Tamra and Kelly ruined the show.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you, honey," Vicki responded. "The show has turned into something that was not intended."</p><p>Vicki clearly has had enough with Season 14 of the show, making us more than excited to see the reunion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is Vicki getting married to Steve Lodge?</h2><p>After Vicki broke up with Brooks Ayers (who faked having cancer), we couldn't have been more thrilled to see her with cop and retired soldier Steve Lodge. The couple got engaged in April, and if she stays on the show, it would be an excellent storyline to see their nuptials. This would be the third marriage for Vicki.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Back in August, the reality star took to Instagram live to answer some questions about herself. She said that she and Steve were still trying to figure out if their wedding would be a public or private affair.</p><p>She also said that she's looking forward to taking Steve's last name, so perhaps we can expect to see Vicki Lodge on the cast list for Season 15 of RHOC (we can dream, can't we?)</p><p>RHOC airs on Tuesdays on Bravo at 9 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwsicoqJlo6m2rbiMqKVmp6KWu6ixjJymrqakrnqpu9SsnLChpprA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./backyardigans-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Backyardigans - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-governor-bello-storms-apc-secretariat-meet-committee-members-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Governor Bello Storms APC Secretariat, Meet Committee Members (Video)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
