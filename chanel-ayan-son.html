The teen — who shares the same birthday as Ayan — has already been featured in the pages of Vogue Arabia and can be seen looking absolutely dapper in amazing outfits on Ayan's Instagram page.</p><p>In the series premiere of Real Housewives of Dubai, Ayan and Taj, who the doting mother refers to as her "best friend," played a hand game that she picked up in Kenya. It's clear that these two have an adorable bond that fans are excited to see develop on the show.</p><p>"From the moment you were born, you became the sun to my planet," the reality star wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> on July 8. "Love you cookie and happy us sharing birthdays for eternity."</p><p>Their mother-son bond is all the more touching for viewers who know that Ayan had a less-than-ideal relationship with her own father, whom she hasn't spoken to in over 25 years. "He beat me so bad that I ran away with my sister," she revealed on the show, adding that he wanted to marry her off when Ayan was only 14 years old.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by A Y A N (@chanelayan)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Chanel Ayan's husband?</h2><p>Ayan, who runs a modeling agency and is also developing a makeup and skincare line with Toni Malt, has been happily married for 23 years, according to a post she made on Instagram on June 13, 2022. "I love you @theluckiedude," she wrote, adding the hashtag "#23yearstogether."</p><p>The two met in Brazil when Ayan was kickstarting her career at 17. "I'm married and I'm very proud of that because it was my first love and the only person I have ever been with," the supermodel shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nigerian Tribune</a> in 2019. "I met him when I was 17, he was 22, and we got married and have been living together for 20 years."</p><p>"Yes, I know a lot of models that can't keep relationships, they have many opportunities, meeting different people, so it kind of makes it easy not to keep relationships," she continued. But that's not the case for Ayan. "I believe in love," she declared. "I have kept all my love [these] 20 years, I have kept my kid knowing his mum and dad, compared to how I grew up, that makes me really proud."</p><p>The Real Housewives of Dubai airs on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo, and streams the next day on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiusSlZJqxkaN6tLvN</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./baby-boomer-memes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>26 Times Baby Boomers Tried to Use the Internet and Failed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hunger-games-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Hunger Games - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
