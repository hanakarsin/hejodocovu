Take a look at a few <a href=#>edited Disney movie scenes</a> below — they'll seriously blow your mind.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The 'Lilo & Stitch' laundry scene</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>One edited scene that has recently garnered attention is the Lilo & Stitch laundry scene. According to BuzzFeed, Lilo had originally hid from her sister, Nani, in the dryer when the film first premiered in theaters. However, Disney apparently edited the scene since the movie premiered, to make it look like she's hiding behind a pizza box on a shelf, to hopefully <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deter children from climbing into dryers.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Part of 'Aladdin's "Arabian Nights"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the "Arabian Nights" scene in Aladdin was edited</a> after the movie premiered in theaters. Apparently, according to ScreenRant, one of the lines stated "they cut off your ear if they don't like your face," and the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee protested because it was deemed insensitive. When the movie came out on VHS, it was completely re-edited, with a brand new line in its place.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">"Human Again" in 'Beauty and the Beast'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Apparently, the original cut of Beauty and the Beast included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a huge musical montage</a> in which all of the inanimate objects sing about being human again. While the movie did include some of it, Disney apparently cut a full seven minutes from the original cut of the film, according to The Binger, which makes us wonder what we missed out on... including those strangely sensual moments with Lumiere, the strangely lovable candelabra.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Abominable' was straight-up banned in several countries for this one scene</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Abominable was a heart-warming movie about a young girl in Shanghai who finds a yeti, but apparently, the film was banned throughout Vietnam, The Philippines, and in Malaysia for a particularly controversial scene —&nbsp;Yee pulls out a map that shows something called the nine dash line, which China instilled, claiming much of the South China Sea as its territory. It violates maritime laws, and since it has caused tension between China and much of Southeast Asia, they pulled the film from theaters.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rachelle in 'Planes' was depicted differently around the world</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>If you happened to catch the movie Planes you may remember Rachelle, the adorable pink and white plane who is especially enticing to fellow male planes. But according to CBR, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her name and appearance varies by country</a>. We aren't sure why different branches of Disney decided to edit it that way, but to each their own.</p><p>Disney movies are edited and updated all the time from when they first premiered, whether it's to stay relevant or promote new and positive messages. There is certainly nothing wrong with them deciding to do so, but it's safe to say that it's definitely jarring, especially for OG Disney fans.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0usSyZKanpp6ybr%2FCnqWeq12asarAxJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./endsars-us-threatens-to-halt-military-aid-to-nigeria-over-human-rights-abuses.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>US Threaten To Halt Military Aid To Nigeria Over Human Rights Abuses</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lisa-loring-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>OG Wednesday Addams Has Died</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
