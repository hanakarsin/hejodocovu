Sure, it's supposed to be a time of reflection and laughter and love between your family, friends, and those you hold dear. Maybe it's a time to make amends with lifelong enemies like that lame <a href=#>neighbor</a> who calls the cops on you for letting your guests park their cars on your lawn. All right, maybe that's a little too much to ask for.</p><p>And while all of that feel-good, cheesy stuff that we secretly wish and fight to honestly believe deep down inside is the stuff that truly makes living worthwhile, you can always count on our species' disgusting ability to pollute whatever good we create.</p><p>When it comes to the holidays, there sure are a lot of socio-cultural mores and consumerist tricks to make you feel like you're not celebrating properly unless you're dropping a wad of cash.</p><p>Or maybe you're a more "frugal" shopper and wait for this time of the year to find crazy sales online so you can fill your home up with as many items as you can to stave off existential dread or cover up the fact that you've been too cowardly to truly go after love, whether it's in your career or a relationship.</p><p>Or maybe you know, you just need a bunch of stuff and you want to be fiscally responsible, that works too. Whatever the case may be, this FedEx driver really wishes you didn't order stuff online around Black Friday.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>TikTok user and FedEx employee @RogerRuiz24 caused quite the stir on the platform after his now-deleted post went viral. In the post, he showed the back of his FedEx truck highlighting all of the deliveries he had to make the day after Black Friday.</p><p>The day after Thanksgiving sale has become synonymous with just about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worst in human behavior</a>: there are reports of people getting into fist-fights, folks getting trampled, others getting stabbed, just because someone wants to save $50 on a floor model TV set or get a pack of artificially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marked down HDMI cables on sale</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>After multiple complaints against FedEx arise for dumping missing packages, a driver has taken pictures of overwhelming load of packages.<a href=#>https://t.co/MyWGOX9xS4</a></p>â€” Landon (@WhiteWindLandon) <a href=#>December 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @WhiteWindLandon</span></figure><p>So to avoid all of this craziness, many people opt to just do all of their Black Friday/Cyber Monday shopping online. No sweat off of the consumer's back, right? They can order what they want off of their smartphone off of the comfort of their own toilet seat, and go on their merry way.</p><p>But it is people's jobs to deliver these packages, and if you've ever planned on exclusively shopping for the Holidays online, well, then you know you need to get your orders in several weeks early because delays are just par the course during the busiest time of the year for commerce.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our FedEx Driver was beside himself today.

Itâ€™s a hell of a lot of work, and itâ€™s tiresome," one person commented.</p><p>Another commenter stated, "We appreciate you."</p><p>Roger responded to those who supported his venting clip, "Thank you. And for real, theyâ€™re pressed, but Iâ€™m still working â€¦ but this is the world we live in."</p><p>Many folks took umbrage with one part of the video, where Roger wrote, "F*** work but i'll see y'all tomorrow."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a> contacted FedEx and asked them about the TikTok, and received the following response: "The sentiments expressed in this video are inconsistent with the professionalism FedEx team members and service providers demonstrate every day in safely and securely delivering millions of packages to our customers."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have semi mixed feelings on this.
