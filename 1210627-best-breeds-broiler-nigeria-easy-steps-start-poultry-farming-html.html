You have to see how many investments your poultry farm will need: fees for farm rental, purchasing chicks, food, money paid as a salary for workers on your farm, and medical care.</li><li><strong>Learn from professionals.</strong> Feel free to ask and study all information related to production. Visit (if possible) large poultry farms; consult your business colleagues, as well as veterinarians.</li><li><strong>Target location.</strong> When choosing a place for a farm, you should pay attention, primarily, proximity to the market. Moreover, avoid territories set close to rivers and water sources, because that can spread viruses and the broiler wastes to nearby areas. Broiler production has its peculiarities, one of which is the smell.</li><li><strong>Check your “broiler pen” or “chicken house.”</strong> Before buying chicks, check everything once more. The poultry is a kind of living beings, which is a warm-blooded one. It should include a special temperature control system, good ventilation, clearing facilities and enough space to place the necessary number of the fowl.</li><li><strong>Get food and water done. </strong>Planning a farm for poultry, one couldn’t miss such an efficient feature as equipment for feeding. Moreover, the poultry drinks water. Within a huge production, this system should provide water and grains automatically. Do not place the feeders on the ground to avoid moisture propagation and bacteria multiplication – in other words, “keep your chicks dry.”</li><li><strong>Get the right Chicken breeds. </strong>When you finally have all the things prepared, it is time to purchase chicken broilers. Buy only from a trusted owner. Each chick should be clear, healthy and weigh between 35-40 grams.</li><li><strong>Welcome home! </strong>Before the chicks arrive home, you should get their “chicken houses” prepared. First of all, disinfect all equipment that will be in touch with chicken broilers. Then, pre-heat the house for a minimum of 24 hours before the arrival. You should also ensure enough water (it is crucial for chicks’ development on the early stages), artificial heat, and look at your poultry farm as if you were a small chick coming to live there (Is it comfortable enough? Is the access to food and water simple?)</li><li><strong>Medical care service.</strong> Consult specialists and hold regular vaccination for broilers. Remember that prevention is better than cure.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6e0e91f466a0a734.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most expensive cheese 2019 and its price will wow you</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ef853bf32e98a60f.jpg><p class=align-left>The first thing you have to do before starting your own business is to define its target: whether you wish to grow chickens for meat, eggs or production.
