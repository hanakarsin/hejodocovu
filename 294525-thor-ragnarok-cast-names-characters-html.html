The first film in the Thor series was released in 2011 and was based on the Marvel Comic character by the same name. What most people do not know is that the very first attempt that was made to turn the comic into a novel was made in 1991. The developers, however, did not have enough material to develop, and they left the entire film in development limbo for many years before it was finally made. The most notable member of the Thor Ragnarok cast is, of course, the Hunk himself, Liam Hemsworth.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/f630a911225e9958.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since the release of the first Thor film in 2011, Paramount Studios have followed it up with two sequels. In 2013, Thor the Dark World was released, and in 2017, Ragnarok came out. In the original Thor movie, the main character, Thor, gets banished from Asgard. His evil brother Loki is planning to take over. Thor has to prove himself so that he can get the approval of his father and get back the control of the kingdom. Well, here are a few things that you need to know about Thor Ragnarok cast names and characters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fa3c1440edb105c1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the most powerful Avenger?

He finds himself in a tight race against time, in an attempt to get back to Asgard and protect it from Ragnarok, the destruction that has been planned by Hela. Remember that Thor has been held up in Sakaar, and he does not have his hammer. Among the close to impossible tasks that he has to accomplish is beating an old Friend, Hulk so he can head back to Asgard. Only after defeating Hulk in a duel will he be allowed to assemble a team made of Hulk, Valkyrie, and Loki, and then together they can head back to Asgard.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Real Househelps of Kawangware cast</p><h2>The main Thor Ragnarok characters</h2><p class=align-left>Below is a list of the main characters behind making of Thor Ragnarok;</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/86de8008a8dcff0f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids cast now: profiles, roles, latest updates</span></p></a><h3>1.Thor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fa3c1440edb105c1.jpeg><p class=align-left>Thor is the main character, just like he was in all the other movies that are part of the series. The Australian hunk, Christ Hemsworth play the character. In the movies, Thor is the crown prince of Asgard. A few things happen to the character in this movie, which is a little different than what happens in all the other four movies -Thor sports shorter hair than he did in the other movies. Then, there is the fact that his hammer, the Mjolnir is destroyed and he loses one eye. When asked about these plot twists, the directors said that Chris Hemsworth felt that he had portrayed the same character for a very long time, and he was ready to play around with the character.</p><h3>2. Loki</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/86de8008a8dcff0f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Tom Hiddleston plays this character. Loki is an adoptive brother to Thor, and he is a nemesis, named after a god by the same name. Loki, as we all know him, is always mischievous and is constantly looking for new ways to be naughty. He has been the ruler of Asgard since the end of Thor-the Dark World. Loki, as we know is a trickster and is always looking for new ways to go against the rules. Loki is not necessarily interested in good governance, what bothers him, is his image.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/819d5fb99a2cb0a3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Borat: 10 fun facts about the movie.

Thor Ragnarok Hela</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/67f53d476547bc83.jpeg><p class=align-left>This is the main antagonist in the movie. Cate Blanchett plays the character. Hela is Thor’s older sister; she is also the goddess of death. She has been released from Jail by mistake. Did you know that there was a point during the creation of the comic when they thought about making Hela Loki’s siblings, as opposed to being Thor’s sister? However, the writers decided that Thor’s last confrontation would be more impactful if it were with his blood sister.</p><h3>4. Heimdall</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/6bba70ba6c5cc8f8.jpeg><p class=align-left>The gorgeous Idris Elba plays this character. Heimdall is all hearing and all hearing sentry to the Bilfrost Bridge. He has been on a self-imposed exile throughout the reign by Loki. However, when Hela invades Asgard, he helps hide the vulnerable citizens. In this new movie, we see Elba’s role transform from that of an elder statesman and a gatekeeper to a serious warrior that receives a lot of action when trying to save his people from destruction.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2ce0d52f2e03893f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Eddie from "Kickin It"?</span></p></a><h2>5. Grandmaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/819d5fb99a2cb0a3.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Grandmaster is one of the universe elders. He is also the ruler of the planet of Sakaar. None other than Jeff Goldblum plays the character. Jeff states that it took a lot of improvisation on his part to turn the idea that was on the script to a character that was his own. Even though the character is not blue as described in the comics, his essence still shines through.</p><h3>6. The Hulk</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/46d030e98632173a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Mark Ruffalo plays this character. The hulk is a science genius who has discovered a way to transform into a furious monster when agitated. He made his debut in these films when he appeared in The Age of Ultron. In the two years since then, he has become such a gladiator on Sakaar. Unlike the other movies where he was just a killing machine, Ruffalo feels that his character had some swag in this movie.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/04f2dc5669eab414.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 greatest boxing movies of all time</span></p></a><h3>7. Odin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/88697a3e2c65798d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Odin is the king of Asgard. He is the father to Thor and Hela, and he also adopted Loki. They wanted him to be disguised as a hobo on the streets of New York during his exile but changed the script when they realized that would be more tragic than it would be funny, especially based on the way that he died. The role is played wonderfully by Antony Hopkins. He amazes everyone by the way that he deconstructs the role, and what had become of it in all the past movies, and he creates a humorous alternative for the same.</p><h3>8. Thor Ragnarok cast Korg</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2ce0d52f2e03893f.jpeg><p class=align-left>This is one of the favorite non-human characters in the film. Korg is made of pure rocks and is one of the hilarious characters in the film. Taika Waititi himself plays the role (how cool is that?). Korg is a member of the foreign Kronan species, and his presence is very welcome in Thor. Taika Waititi says that the actions and the mannerisms that he portrays in this characters were inspired by nightclub bouncers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c458efcdbde24fa3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A Gentleman in Moscow: How did the story end?</span></p></a><h3>9. Valkyrie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/18e7ae64346add77.jpeg><p class=align-left>One of the most amazing things about Thor Ragnarok was the inclusion of the character, Valkyrie. It was even more amazing because Tessa Thomson, a woman of color, got to play the part. Everyone was stoked to see what she would deliver because besides her, only Idris Elba, playing Asgard’s gatekeeper, was a person of color. It is also ironic that Valkyrie seemed to have a preference for a romance with a person from the same gender as her, and even though this was left out of the final cut, it is the thought that counts when diversity is concerned. For the first time in a long time, it was amazing to see a character getting pulled out of the comic books and being transformed into something so empowering. Everyone stated that they were stoked about the character being transformed into a full role instead of being blended in as something regrettable such as Asgardian 35.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7rgg80gu6a9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool movies to watch 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Tahidi high actors & actresses real names</p><h2>Some of the funniest moments delivered by Korg and others in the movie</h2><p class=align-left>One of the most amazing things about Thor Ragnarok was the amount of humor which was in the film. Taika Waikiki, through his role as Korg, delivered most of these humorous moments. Interestingly, Taika says that when they were carving out the role, they did not want to imagine Korg would be as humorous as he ended up becoming. They intended him to say a line or two, but Christ Hemsworth liked the character so much that they even had to do motion capture for his actions. Here are some of the most brilliant hidden jokes:</p><ul><li>The appearance that Matt Damon Makes: At the start of the movie, Loki is posing as Odin. The funny thing about this part is that instead of it being played by Tom Hiddleston, it is Matt Damon, in a hilariously bad wig. An even funnier turn of events is that it is not the first time that Matt has played this character, in Kevin Smith’s Dogma, he and Ben Affleck played the roles of fallen angels. The name of Matt Damon’s Angel character was none other than Loki.</li><li>Another Thor? Another amazing and yet very hilarious thing about this movie is that there is another character playing Thor, and it is another of the ridiculously handsome Hemsworth men, Luke Hemsworth. Luke is not as famous as Liam, which made him the perfect person to use for this gag.</li><li>Korg’s Misfortune: Towards the end of the film, Korg accidentally crushes his blade-armed gladiator friend. He ends up thinking that he may have killed him. While this may sound tragic, it is hilarious when you think about it from this perspective; Korg is rock and gladiator’s blades represent scissors. So it appears that rock triumphs over scissors. This joke gets even funnier. When he is trying to tell Thor about his attempt to start a revolution, but he was unable to print enough paper for the same, he is insinuating that paper beat rock.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Those are just a few of the precious moments which made this film as memorable as it was.</p><h2>What Taika Waititi thinks about the character that he created?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/4900e178c2124f74.jpeg><p class=align-left>Taika Waititi is an award-winning <a id=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169806/awards href=# title="Thor Ragnarok characters" rel="nofollow noopener">film director</a>, actor, and comedian from New Zealand. He has won many awards for some of the films that he has written and directed in the past. However, a new and interesting dimension to his career opened up when he decided to play the role of Korg in Thor. He ended up creating one of the hilarious characters for the movie, and everyone is hoping that if there are sequels, they will get to see more of this rock character.</p><p class=align-left>Taika states that when he was setting out to do the voice over for the character, he did not expect that it would go so well that the fans would be looking forward to more. He first captured the voice-overs for the character, and then he did the motion capture. The reason why a director was playing the role of an actor is because the rock character was supposed to be so negligible that no one would think about it. Fortunately, Taika delivered pure gold and everyone smiles when a scene brings him on.</p><p class=align-left>Those are the moments and the characters which made Thor Ragnarok the most amazing of the now three-part movie. There is hope that there will still be another sequel. Even though no one knows for a fact that it will be all about, we can assume that it will be as amazing as or even better than the others. We can also hope that the changes which will be made to the Thor Ragnarok cast as it is will be to make an even better follow up on where the story ends.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: List of Inspector Mwala actors and their real names</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BmG1sa21dqbWwvoyrmKCmkae8rHnCmqqtZZ6Wuqa%2FjJyfmqqRmMGmvtJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./southern-charm-filming-locations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Does It Take Place?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-oyo-sdp-candidate-accuses-pdp-of-destroying-all-his-billboards-says-they-are-afraid-of-defeat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oyo SDP Candidate Accuses PDP Of Destroying All His Billboards, Says They Are Afraid Of Defeat</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
