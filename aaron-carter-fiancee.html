"Melanie and I have the same goals in life," Aaron shared with his Instagram followers, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>"I'm just showing her a different side of love that I myself am not accustomed to," he continued. "So that's why I made it a point to do things differently. Obviously my sweetheart and I have different lifestyles. She moved in with me and has been communicating at least 12 hours a week to be home."</p><p>"I've never met a woman more invested into me than you my darling @missmelaniemartin," he captioned a lengthy Instagram post.

On June 12, 2020, he posed a photo of Melanie's hand wearing an engagement ring.</p><p>"Love wins #iloveyou3000 #engaged #fiance #ourlovestory," Aaron captioned the photo, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>The proposal came just days after the couple experienced a pregnancy loss, which Aaron revealed during a YouTube livestream with Melanie. "She suffered a miscarriage due to stress conditions," he explained. "We're gonna give it some time, let her heal, and then we're going to try again. We both want that. I gotta take care of her."</p><p>Now that the couple are pregnant again, Melanie recently shared that their baby is due Nov. 18, 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Aaron and Melanie briefly split after she was arrested for domestic violence.</h2><p>In March 2020, just weeks after he added her name to above his right eyebrow, Aaron and Melanie got into a fight that escalated to the point where law enforcement had to be called.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @missmelaniemartin</a></p></figure><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the LA County Sheriff's Department responded to a domestic violence call from Aaron's home. Aaron reportedly had visible marks, and the police determined Melanie to be the aggressor; she was arrested for felony domestic violence, per the outlet. She was held on $50,000 bail, and while Aaron told&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;directly that there was "no chance" he and Melanie would get back together, get back together they did – just a few days after the former child star called her #FelonyMelanie on Twitter. Oof!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Domestic spats are hopefully a thing of the past, but Aaron Carter has a very important fight coming up.</h2><p>Outside of his home life, the teen idol is set to step into the ring with former basketball player Lamar Odom on Friday, June 11, in a sold-out celebrity match that will be live streamed for $29.99 on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fite.TV.</a></p><p>"I grew up street fighting, and I'm really looking forward to this match," Aaron said in an online video, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>.
