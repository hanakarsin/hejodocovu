This week, it looks like new leaks have fizzled to the surface involving some of the future Marvel Studios plans, namely a potential addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the form of a little movie called Young Avengers. According to Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joshuamunn213</a>, there could be some very interesting developments coming down the line for the property.&nbsp;</p><p>What could the leaks mean for Marvel fans looking to hear more about Young Avengers? We've got all the info currently floating around out there, even though it's a bit sparse. Keep in mind, as joshuamunn213 indicates, that you should of course take all this information with a grain of salt, but it's still pretty cool to think about!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Comics</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What's going on with 'Young Avengers' in the MCU and are they getting their own movie?</h2><p>It's very possible that a Young Avengers film could be in the pipeline. According to the leaks, the third entry in the Ant-Man movie series could potentially set up a Young Avengers team. From there, a movie or a show could spring forth, lead by Scott Lang's daughter Cassie Lang. The show would also feature Ms. Marvel, Kate Bishop, Kid Loki, and Scarlet Witch's children Speed and Wiccan.&nbsp;</p><p>After the new Young Avengers team is introduced with Ant-Man 3, they may also start showing up in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several other Disney+ shows</a>, some of them with their own individual appearances on self-titled series. This could include Kate Bishop in Hawkeye and Speed and Wiccan in WandaVision as well as Kid Loki in the show Loki.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are the 'Young Avengers,' anyway?</h2><p>The Young Avengers are essentially just what they sound like. They're a superhero team all with relationships to the Avengers themselves. The original series debuted in 2006 and ended up winning the 2006 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book. This ragtag bunch of teenage heroes includes personalities like Hulkling, Marvel Boy, Speed, Hawkeye, and Patriot. If you haven't heard of several of these members of the group, don't worry, as a movie or show could get you caught up quick.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Comics</span></figure><p>There's a lot of Young Avengers stories to sift through at present to prep yourself for any possible movie or TV show coming down the line. But it seems like if there is a new show or movie on the horizon based on the property, there will be several chances to get caught up with some of the characters you may have not been paying attention to throughout Marvel's many universes.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it's a good idea not to get your hopes up for a Young Avengers show or movie just yet, as Marvel hasn't made any sort of official announcement that it's definitely going to happen. If it does, however, we'll be sure you know, and we'll be delving into all the details once more when they finally do surface. Stay vigilant, True Believers!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrry2usZmmK%2Bdnpyys7%2BMpqavoZU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./black-pumas-grammy-nomination.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What to Know About the Brand-New Duo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./427827-kenya-yashindwa-kutoa-chanjo-ya-pfizer-sababu-ya-kukosa-sindano-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenya Yashindwa Kutoa Chanjo ya Pfizer Sababu ya Kukosa Sindano</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
