The show is vastly different from the Archie comic book series it was based on because it's far darker.&nbsp;</p><p>While the show's dynamic changes basically every week, there's one thing we can be sure of: Jughead Jones' grandfather is going to be the key to unlocking a lot of the mysteries surrounding his grandson. Forsyth Jones I has been mentioned throughout Season 4, and we can finally put a face to the name with actor Timothy Webber.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jughead's family life is rocky, to say the least, and it's unlikely that things will change when he meets his grandpa. But, Jughead has been learning on Season 4 that he may have more in common with his grandfather than he ever could have imagined.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is Timothy Webber from Riverdale?</a> Read on to find out more about Jughead's grandfather, and where you've seen him before.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Timothy Webber on Riverdale? Details on his character.&nbsp;</h2><p>Jughead (who is played by Cole Sprouse) has attended more high schools than the average student, and in Season 4, he's enrolled in Stonewall Prep. The school immediately gives Jughead a weird feeling, which he later learns is because he's not the first Jones to attend. That's right, Forsyth I had gone to Stonewall, but he left under mysterious circumstances.</p><p>His grandson later learns that Forsyth I was actually one of the authors of the Baxter Brothers books, which Jughead himself had grown up reading. The books have been written by various Stonewall alums, and Jughead is competing to become the next author.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Unraveling a new mystery.

But it's not yet known whether or not the books caused Forsyth I to leave the school. It's been hinted that the competition to win authorship of the next Baxter Boys book will also explain what Jughead's foreshadowed "death" is about.</p><p>Jughead had also thought that his grandfather had died from over-drinking years earlier. When he finds out that his grandpa is living an isolated life in the woods, Jughead turns up on his doorstep to learn more about his role in writing some of the Baxter Boys books.&nbsp;</p><p>Because nothing is as it seems in Riverdale, Jughead is likely going to uncover a lot about his family when he talks to his grandfather, and we have a suspicion that Forsyth I isn't going to be too eager to walk down memory lane.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What has Timothy Webber been in before?</h2><p>The Canadian actor is best known for playing The Apprentice on ABC's Once Upon a Time. He first appeared on the series in 2014's fourth season, and he regularly appeared in Season 5.
