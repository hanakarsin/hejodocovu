They are bent on removing him and the national secretary. They have compiled their sins, presented them to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and are ready to send them out of office during the NEC meeting on Wednesday.</p><p>“But in order to mitigate the impact such removal could have on the party and the new administration, a group of party stalwarts met with the chairman tonight (last night) to advise him to resign rather than being shown the exit door at the NEC meeting slated for Wednesday, and he agreed.”</p><p>Yet, another source claimed that having seen the handwriting on the wall, Adamu and Omisore decided to throw in the towel ahead of the NWC meeting slated for noon today to avoid complicating the situation.</p><p>The source explained, “A meeting of NWC has been called for Monday at the instance of the national chairman. As usual, no agenda is on the notice of the meeting. The feelers I am getting included the fact that the chairman has been advised to throw in the towel. The truth is that the whole matter is enveloped in a lot of secrecy.”</p><p>One other source said the APC leadership had since identified a replacement for Omisore, but what delayed the change in leadership, including the postponement of the caucus meetings slated for a penultimate week, was the choice of replacement for Adamu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZqedk2K6prHToqWgZZGlsG7Azmanq6egpMCmecyim62doqJ6prjEnKuirpVisLC61Z6lraGfo3q1u4yeo56bpGKupa3MrmSopZmovLOx0maqrpuTmsC0u9GsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-brigette-lundy-paine-gay.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brigette Lundy Paine Is as Queer as They Come</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
