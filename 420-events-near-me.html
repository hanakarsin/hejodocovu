We've got you covered with these "high holiday" festivities in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Colorado, Michigan, and even New York.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>Stoners, the day we've all been waiting for all year is finally upon us. And if that's not good news enough, take the fact that 4/20 falls on a Saturday this year, which happens, like, once a decade. So, this weekend is about to require a go big or go home kind of attitude, and we can't wait to share our celebratory picks with you.</p><p>But first, a little bit of trivia for all you potheads — just try not to forget it when the doob hits!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is 4/20 weed day?&nbsp;</h2><p>Did you know that we owe our favorite holiday to some high schoolers from Marin County's San Rafael High School who, back in the '70s, toked together every day at 4:20 p.m? Talk about dedication! They would say "420" when they passed each other in the halls, which was code for marijuana.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Anyway, since we're indebted to Marin County for giving us the highest holiday, we've picked the best 4/20 celebrations in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Colorado, Michigan and even New York, for good measure. Make sure you have a pen and paper, or just bookmark this page, so you don't get all "Dude, where's that list?" by the time Saturday rolls around.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4/20 events near you:&nbsp;</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bay Area</h2><p>It makes sense to begin where the holiday was born, in no other place than California's beautiful Bay Area. This year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hippie Hill</strong></a> (located at the eastern end of Golden Gate Park) will serve as the central gathering point if you want to light up at 4:20 on 4/20. Last year, nearly 20,000 people attended the event, according to official San Francisco Park and Recreation estimates.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: 420 Hippie Hill</a></figure><p>If you're in a political mood, celebrate the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green New Deal</a> this 4/20 (which also happens to fall on Earth Day) in the Mission District.<strong> </strong>A huge plus is that the Mission has the city's best burritos and ice cream — both of which you'll be dying to nom once the munchies hit.</p><p>And if you're feeling extra... well, extra, join the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9th Annual Earth Day World Naked Bike Ride</a> and bare what you dare — "sun clad nakedness, go topless, bikinis, body paint or latex, leotard or lingerie, or tuxedos, whatever you feel like" — to bike around in protest of unsustainable energy. Anything for Mother Earth!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Kaleidoscope Experience</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Los Angeles</h2><p>If you find yourself in SoCal, there's no shortage of 4/20 events either. How lovely to spend the holiday in a state where even recreational marijuana is legal! For one, there's the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaleidoscope Experience</a>, an immersive multi-sensory playground for adults where senses are stimulated, games and activities are provided and your imagination is guaranteed to be inspired. Also wait, there's unlimited tater tots. Most definitely count us in.</p><p>If you'd rather attend a low-key dance party, where smoking is not only allowed but also encouraged, hit up the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenhouse Party</a> in Downtown LA from 9 p.m. $60 bucks gets you entrance with pre-rolled flowers and unlimited signature cocktails (hopefully infused with THC), but you can also buy entrance just by itself for $40 in pre-sale. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shred 420</a> also promises to be a fun musical event with Grateful Dead cover band, Grateful Shred. Can you think of better tunes to soundtrack your stony Saturday?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Colorado</h2><p>Start your 4/20 with an energizing, educational hike — the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mile High 4.20K</a> — if you can wake up before 8 a.m. Then head over to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Joint</a> for the Campanelli Glass Show, where you can see the most gorgeous blown glass you'll have ever feasted your eyes on.</p><p>There's a bunch going on in the evening, as well. For one, there's the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Third Annual Mile High Burlesque Fest</a> where several performers will be competing for the title of the "Most High," "Best Buds," and "Master of the Munchies." Any chance we nominate ourselves?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Robinson & The Nasty Delicious</a> will be performing comedy at the Stanley Hotel at 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., and we can't think of anyone funnier than Craig (who's been in films like Knocked Up and Hot Tub Time Machine) to share our 4/20s with.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michigan</h2><p>This Saturday marks Michigan's first legal 4/20 since recreational cannabis passed last November — and they're making sure to start on a high (ha!) note. Join the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>420 Puff & Paint Party</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you're the kind of pothead who adores crafting. The party includes food, drinks, a 9x12 painting and a raffle ticket. You can BYOW or BYOB, but the event is 21+.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Kushstock Michigan</a></figure><p>The 18+ crowd can join <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kushstock Michigan</a> in Clio, for live music by Mitch Ryder, Blue Flex and more. It's free to get in, and they're offering free water, clean restrooms, live art, live glassblowing, skaters' paradise and a ring of fire wrestling. Well, our curiosity is certainly piqued! If you have some $20 burning a hole in your pocket, and love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jai Wolf</a>, don't miss the chance to see him live at the Majestic Theater.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">New York</h2><p>Weed might not yet be legal in New York, but it might as well be —&nbsp;considering all the pot lovers who celebrate in the city every year. This year, start your Saturday with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">420 Yoga in the Bronx</a> — because would any 4/20 list be complete without stoner yoga? Grab your mat, a joint or edible, and your favorite stoner buddy and head up to Clason Point Park. Blazing starts at 12:30 and one-hour yoga begins at 1 p.m.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: House of Yes</a></figure><p>If any New Yorkers are feeling especially entrepreneurial, head over to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men of Color in Cannabis</a>, a round-table discussion where people can understand where they fit or discover ways to join the booming cannabis industry. But try and save some energy for the evening, as House of Yes is hosting a spectacular-looking party called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flying High</a> that promises to keep you "floating through the solar system" and soaring on the dance floor all night long.</p><p>Happy 4/20! May your Saturday be filled with all highs and no lows..</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfaX9xecSvnKeso2K7pq3RZqSe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jlo-and-vanessa-hudgens-same-dress-met-gala.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez and Vanessa Hudgens Weren't Actually Twinning at the Met Gala</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ellie-in-season-3-you.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Have We Seen the Last of Ellie in 'You'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
