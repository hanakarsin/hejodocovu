This situation has reportedly attracted the attention of English Premier League clubs such as Chelsea, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur, who are said to be interested in signing the talented Nigerian international.</p><p>Jacobs, however, mentioned that Osimhen’s price tag could potentially decrease if he fails to commit to a new contract. Recall that the 24-year-old Super Eagles star joined Napoli from Ligue 1 side Lille in 2020 and played a crucial role in the team’s success in the previous season.</p><p>Meanwhile, Arsenal’s legend, <strong>Sol Campbell,</strong> believes Nigerian striker <strong>Victor Osimhen</strong> could help the Gunners achieve their dream of winning the Premier League this season.</p><p>Arsenal’s attacking-minded players, Leandro Trossard, Eddie Nketiah, and Gabriel Jesus, have scored a combined 14 goals in all competitions so far this season, a situation Campbell feels is not welcoming enough for the Gunners.</p><p>So far this season, Arsenal as a team, have recorded a total of 26 Premier League goals and conceded 10. They are currently sitting 3rd in the league table with 27 points in 12 games, a point below first-placed Manchester City.</p><p>This means that the Gunners still have a huge chance to battle for the Premier League title against City who have recorded 32 goals so far in the league.</p><p>Hence, Sol Campbell thinks that before Arsenal can compete favourably for the league title, they need a striker that can score 20 to 25 Premier League goals per season.</p><p>The ideal man for the Gunners is Osimhen, who helped Napoli to win the Scudetto for the first time in 33 years after scoring 26 goals and providing five assists, according to Campbell.</p><p>Apart from Osimhen, another striker that is being linked with Arsenal is Brentford’s Ivan Toney who has been serving a ban for breaching betting rules.</p><p>When asked who his ideal striker for the Gunners is, Campbell said: “Osimhen. But is he going to cost too much money? There’s Ivan (Toney). I think they’re good (in other areas of the pitch). Centre forward is one thing they might need to look at and see the possibilities, see what’s out there, or wait until next season.</p><p>“But if the right person comes along, an out-and-out striker, that can unlock those tight games, knows what to do in those positions, and also keeps defense occupied to free up other people then, they should maybe look at it Christmas time, and if not, definitely next season. The right person will offload the pressure on the team, I think.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FrZqirmaK1prqMppiyZZyarrexjKeYqaecnnqvsdetZKytnaKys3nTq5inq5aav26x16mcq6xdp7K3scClqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-rose-mciver-pregnant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>People Have Been Wondering If Rose McIver Is Pregnant for Years So Is She?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./moses-brown-basketballplayer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Moses Brown (Basketball Player) - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
