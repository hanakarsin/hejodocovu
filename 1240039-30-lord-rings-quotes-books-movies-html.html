You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.” – J.R.R Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings</li><li>“Home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to thread through shadows to the edge of night, until the stars are all alight.” – J.R.R Tolkien, The Lord of the Ring</li><li>“Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible, and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer.” – J.R.R Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings</li><li>“I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. Well- preserved indeed! Why, I feel all thin, sorts of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, or something.” – J.R.R Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings</li><li>“And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth.

[looks at dead soldier] His sense of duty was no greater than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is. Where he came from and if he really was evil at heart, what lie or threats drove him on this long march from home. Would he no rather was stayed there… in peace? War will make corpses of us all. Bind their hands.” – Faramir</li><li>“The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Saruman and the union of the two towers. Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this middle- earth. The old will burn in the fires of industry. The forest will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the orc.” – Saruman</li><li>“Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past Age, full of its own comings and goings, scarcely aware of the existence of hobbits, for which I am very thankful.” – Galadriel</li><li>“Mordor. The one place in middle-Earth we don’t want to see any closer. And it’s the one place we’re trying to get it. It’s just where we can’t get. Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost.” – Sam</li><li>“I thought up an ending for my book.

No, the journey doesn’t end here. Death is just another path… One that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass… And then you see it… White shores… and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.” – Gandalf, The Return of the King</li><li>“War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.” – Faramir, The Two Towers</li><li>“It’s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end… because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing… this shadow. Even darkness must pass.” – Sam, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</li><li>“You can search far and wide. You can drink the whole town dry. But you’ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown. You can drink your fancy ales. You can drink them by the flagon. But the only brew for the brave and tru-u-u-ue comes from the Green Dragon!” –Merry & Pippin, The return of the King</li><li>“A time may come soon… when none will return. Then there will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds that are done in the last defense of your homes.
