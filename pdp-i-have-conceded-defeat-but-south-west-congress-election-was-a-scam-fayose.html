I conceded because the PDP is a bigger picture. I want to say that conceding does not amount to defeat, it is sheer exhibiting leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Take a look at the result and the characters behind the result before I will tell you the issue. I am on one side alone; I have on the side of Governor Makinde, two former governors – Segun Oni and Olagunsoye Oyinlola. They have on their side seven deputy governors and two speakers and serving senators.</p><p>“The results in quotes, Arapaja scored 343. My candidate Eddy Olafeso scored 330, a difference of 13 votes. I’m glad because that is a show of strength. Whether the result is right or wrong, the world can see in the one-man army that has faced them all and without rigging, they lost.”</p><p>When asked if the election was rigged, Fayose replied in the affirmative saying: “Very clearly.”</p><p>The former Governor added that he approached the court to obtain an order to prevent his party from conducting the congress in Oyo State over fear of violence.</p><p>He alleged that the violence came from Oyo to Osun with 200 buses bearing the number plates of Oyo, adding that they blocked the venue of the exercise.</p><p>Fayose added, “They came with cutlasses and guns all night, it was in the public knowledge.”</p><p>Speaking further, he accused the collation officer, Chris Anyanwu from Imo State of discrepancies while counting the votes cast.</p><p>Despite his reservations for the zonal congress, Fayose insisted that he would not be a party to those who will say the PDP will not move forward.</p><p>“For me, as to that election, it was a scam but I must agree as a leader of the PDP. I have been working for this party. I am one of the voices that cannot be forgotten in the PDP.</p><p>“And I will not sit down here and say because of 13 votes, because of manipulation, the party must not move forward,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5BtZqmcoGK2brTAr5xmm5%2BjsKawxJ1knZ2Wmq61ecGuq2arn6rBqXnWnqqtZZOku6i%2BxKyqZp2cmrC1tc6nZLCZo2Kubr%2FCmqRmnpGuvLSxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-daylight-saving-time-ending-for-good.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Daylight Saving Time Offiically Ending?
