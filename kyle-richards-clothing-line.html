On the premiere of the tenth season, the women on the cast will walk in New York Fashion Week to model Kyle's latest clothing line, which is called Kyle and Shahida.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Richards' clothing line</a> will also be the center of drama on RHOBH.

In September of 2019, it was announced that Kyle had partnered with designer Shahida Clayton for a resort ready-to-wear collection. The pair branded their collection as Kyle and Shahida.&nbsp;</p><p>Shahida has been manufacturing clothes under her line, Shahida Parides, since 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>The items in the collection center around nature prints for tropical weather, and they retail from around $85 to $450. Of course, Kyle's signature look on the show is a caftan, which she said were usually from the Shahida Parides line.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Upon the announcement of her new line, Kyle told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD</a> that she was excited to return to the world of fashion.&nbsp;</p><p>"I love being creative in fashion. When I closed my store in Beverly Hills, I saw all these 'for lease' signs, and thought, 'yikes, what should I do?'" Kyle told the outlet. "My husband told me to take a breath, and then I started to talk to Shahida, someone whose work I love and admire — and had been carrying in my stores, and wearing on the show for years."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kyle Richards' clothing line will bring the women together on 'RHOBH.'</h2><p>At the same time their collaboration was announced, it was also revealed that the line would make its debut at NYFW on September 8 with a runway walk at Pier 59.&nbsp;</p><p>The fashion show was filmed for RHOBH, and Kyle's co-stars modeled the clothes in support, as did two of Kyle's daughters. Season 10's Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp, Denise Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Erika Jayne modeled the clothes, while new cast members <a href=#>Garcelle Beauvais</a> and Sutton Stracke watched from the first row.&nbsp;</p><p>While it doesn't seem like a catfight will ensue on the catwalk and spoil Kyle's big day, a preview ahead of the April 15 premiere showed Teddi Mellencamp fighting off the nerves ahead of her walk. As viewers of the show will remember, Teddi's regular walk has been made fun of by her fellow cast members and her husband, Edwin Arroyave on air.&nbsp;</p><p>"In my head, I'm like, 'Teddi, you better not fall,'" Teddi said in the preview for the episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The status of Teddi's runway walk will be revealed on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the NYFW launch, the Kyle and Shahida clothing line has continued to put out new items and collections. Kyle's also hinted at creating a new brick and mortar location in the future.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoMatsYyroJygkaextHnCpaatoJmjtG64yKec</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./im-the-leader-and-grandfather-here-ganduje-boasts-amid-rumours-of-kwankwasos-defection-to-apc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'I'm The Leader And Grandfather Here'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./airbnb-doorbell-rings-middle-of-night.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Doorbell Eerily Starts Ringing at 3 am in Secluded Airbnb, but No One Is There</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
