I want to believe that his emergence to many Nigerians was not only a surprise but is the least that we expected. We expected from the outcome of the election, we expected that our delegates will be reasonable enough to pay back to this person whose dues he has paid extraordinary.</p><p>“We are all proud of the emergence of this gentleman to run for our party because he is one person, take it or not, he is the only candidate in the Federal Republic that will be able to deliver his zone bloc votes intact. Remember when Buhari came to run under the APC arrangement, he was also having the advantage of delivering his zone.”</p><p>According to Doguwa, Tinubu has more than 8-10 million votes from the southwest alone and he gains more votes in the Northwest.</p><p>He expressed surprise that the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo did not withdraw from the race to support Tinubu, claiming that it was clear that the northern governors were behind Tinubu.</p><p>Doguwa said, “I’m surprised that the VP did not step down, I thought so because I have seen how governors from the northern part of the country agreed.</p><p>“Everybody knew even before the election, it was not only an agreement to allow the south to come up a presidential flag bearer, it was beyond that. The governors of the northern part of the country did not only agree to concede power to the south but also galvanized their support and solidarity behind Bola Ahmed Tinubu; it was not a secret. So I thought the VP, Osinbajo would have stepped down being someone that’s a kinsman.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49yZqenoqm1pr7NZp6orqNitaKwjKmgnKOVmXq1tc2uma5lkpqzsL7EZpipm12lv6a%2FyJ2cp6yZlrluvNGipJqqqWK1sLqMnaagraeWfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./426240-jalango-tells-rotimis-lover-jealously-cautioning-vanesa-mdee-ukiachwa-achika-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jalang'o Tells Off Rotimi's Ex-Lover for Jealously Cautioning Vanessa Mdee: &amp;quot;Ukiachwa Achika&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mikayla-demaiter-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mikayla Demaiter - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
