From One Day at a Time to Saved By The Bell to the rumored Friends reunion, we’re living in an age of nostalgia. Millennials are soaking up the memories and streaming services and networks are banking off of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Streaming newcomer, Quibi, announced that they will be bringing back reality prank show, <a href=#>Punk’d</a>. The platform is set to premiere April 6 along with the reboot. Quibi is an upcoming American short-form mobile video platform that will have a variety of short shows, including Punk’d. While it’s exciting to see this show be brought back to life, most people just want to know if the former host and head prankster, <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher, will be returning to be on the new show.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Punk’d’ premiered on MTV in 2003.</h2><p>The original version of Punk’d first premiered in 2003 on MTV with host Ashton Kutcher.

MTV brought the show back in 2012 for a ninth season with guest hosts including Justin Bieber, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>.

Ashton told James, "Nobody called me, nobody asked me," the That '70s Show star said. "I love Chance the Rapper. I think he's amazing, but I didn't even know it was happening. I was flipping through the news on the phone and I was like, 'Oh, they're doing 'Punk'd.'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have nothing to do with the new punk’d situation.

"I have nothing to do with the new punk'd situation," Kutcher <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. "Hope they get it right."</p><p>He seemed a little perturbed by the reboot and miffed he wasn’t asked to be a part of it. He also told James Coron, “I don’t see how they can make it bigger than what it was.” He implied that they wouldn’t be able to get the star-caliber that he did back in the day. He brought up singer Billie Eilish as a possibility for a good candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>Punk’d is set to premiere on Quibi on April 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIyaqqGsn6N6rMHTnJ%2Beql2Xsm67zWalnq9dpcKvt8M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tess-reinhart-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tess Reinhart - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./414973-rais-asiyeheshimu-sheria-maraga-asema-atakavyo-kumbuka-uhuru-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rais Asiyeheshimu Sheria!
