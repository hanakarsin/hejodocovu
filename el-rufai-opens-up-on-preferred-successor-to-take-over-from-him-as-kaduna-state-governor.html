I’ve not anointed anybody. Stories go round.</p><p>“There are some that say I’ve anointed my deputy governor and there are some that say I’ve anointed my Commissioner for Finance and there are some that say I’ve anointed my Commissioner of budget and planning, there are all kinds of stories arounds, but…I don’t want to anoint anyone,” El-Rufai declared during a Channels TV interview session on Wednesday.</p><p>“I think the leadership…our first eleven as I called it, the core leadership of Kaduna State would sit and debate this and see whether we can come up with one person we think is a worthy successor and what that person would do to carry the rest of the team together.</p><p>“We have our core team. We’ve started meeting regularly and even our senators join from Kaduna. We discuss this regularly and at some point, we’re going to make that decision, but we’ve not anointed anyone.</p><p>“If I tell you I don’t have preferences I would be lying. I do have preferences but because I’m human, even though I have preferences, I’m still praying that God chooses the right person for Kaduna State.</p><p>“Because for me, Kaduna is more important than anything, including myself, friendship and any preferences I may have and I’m human only God knows the best person to succeed me. I’m only human.</p><p>“My preference is in our core team, that is the first eleven. I said core team because these are the guys that worked with me since 2014 to organize our party, organized our campaign and we won and got elected.</p><p>“So, they know all the policies we formulated and implemented. So, they’ll not come and have about-turn changing direction.</p><p>“This is why I said our core team. Some are in the cabinet and some are in the National Assembly, but we have our core team and we’ll keep discussing. The reason I want someone from our team to succeed us is because I want continuity,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BpZp6kXafCp63IZqapnZ6oera8jKilZqiimrOmvtGem2arpZiwpr%2FSqKlmrJ9iwaK3xGamr52iYrOzu8xmn6KlXZbAbrfAnaynmV2owaLAxGaeqK6Vp7uwvo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mikayla-demaiter-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mikayla Demaiter - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-chase-briscoe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chase Briscoe Scores Emotional Xfinity Win Days After Losing His First Child</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
