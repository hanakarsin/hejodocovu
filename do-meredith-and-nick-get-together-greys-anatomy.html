But it's only later, at the hotel bar, that they manage to have a decent catch-up. As part of the conversation, they cover topics like recent dates, Nick's niece fleeing the nest, and Meredith's experiences with COVID-19. At one point, Meredith assures Nick she won't sleep with him — and he tells her he won't sleep with her either.</p><p>At this stage, it's uncertain what's next for the two. Fans are very curious to see where Season 18 takes them.</p><p>"Please, I've been waiting for Dr. Nick Marsh to come back to Grey's Anatomy!

"Fake character names, fake scenes at table reads, dailies not released, cuts with omitted scenes.
