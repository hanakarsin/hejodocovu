So, what's up with Jimmy Fallon's new look? Keep reading for all the known details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jimmy Fallon's beard has the fangirls in shambles.</h2><p>After introducing his new look in August 2022, Jimmy Fallon became the latest "white boy of the month" on Twitter. Let's face it — his casual ensemble and unkempt beard had many viewers thirsting after him.</p><p>One fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that Jimmy looked "fine AF" on stage at the Video Music Awards, while another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he was "looking yummy." A third viewer went as far as to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claim</a> the actor looked "daddyish," and a fourth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">referred</a> to Jimmy as a DILF.</p><p>Following the unexpected social media reaction, Jimmy took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> and poked fun by saying he's "out here causing 'thirst' and 'confusion.'" The comments on his post are hilarious, with many begging the Taxi star to avoid a razor at all costs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>JIMMY FALLON IS FINE !!!

Drew teased, adding, "You love it because everyone's saying you're so hot right now."</p><p>The 47-year-old <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner recalled the first time she saw Jimmy's beard, telling the audience she noticed it in front of a lemonade stand with their respective kids: "I was like, 'Oh, so this is a new look,'" Drew said. "And then I hear that everybody saying how hot he looks, and I've noticed, it's still on!"</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After more teasing, Jimmy offered an explanation (if you can really call it that) as to why his beard is still around: "I just kept it on, I figured, I'm just gonna keep it on, I have nothing ... I figured ... I don't know why, I'm just going to leave it on."</p><p>In the end, Drew turned to the audience and said that the beard is a "good look" for Jimmy, and it seems Twitter still agrees because, following the episode, more fans chimed in on Jimmy's facial hair.</p><p>"I’m very sorry, but it must be said: Jimmy Fallon looks fantastic with a beard," one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. "I don't care what y’all have to say about him either, I won’t be convinced otherwise." A few other Twitter users wondered if Jimmy was growing a beard for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new movie</a> or possibly a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween costume</a>. Whatever the reason, I think we can all agree that we love it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auudhmnZqknKS7bq7Emqmd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristen-johnston-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristen Johnston - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./414560-is-amanda-freitag-married-heres-know-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Amanda Freitag married?
