While the track record for film adaptations for video games is far from stellar, there's also the route of the animated series on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. Case in point, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Devil May Cry</a>.</p><p>As a popular video game series from Capcom, Devil May Cry will soon receive its own animated series on Netflix. The show follows in the footsteps of <a href=#>Castlevania</a>, another adult-oriented cartoon based on a game that received critical acclaim across four seasons on Netflix.</p><p>Devil May Cry will also share the same producer as Castlevania in Adi Shankar. Reportedly, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired the rights</a> to produce an animated series for DMC so "the jabronies in Hollywood can't f--k this one up too." While the series was unveiled in 2018, will it be released any time soon?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Capcom</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's the release date for the 'Devil May Cry' animated series?</h2><p>The Devil May Cry video game series began in 2001, and typically follows the gritty and gothic adventures of a demon hunter named Dante. As half-human and half-demon himself, the cocky and confident Dante runs his own shop of odd jobs where he helps clients with demon-related incidents. He uses a variety of weapons and his own patented flashy combat to take out his foes as quickly and stylishly as possible.</p><p>The series includes six games (including one reboot), with its most recent installment being the critically-acclaimed Devil May Cry 5 in 2019. Throughout the series, Dante faces off against gods of the demon world, magical religious cults, and even his own brother and fiercest rival, Vergil.</p><p>Devil May Cry previously had an anime released in 2007 that took place between the first game and 2003's Devil May Cry 2, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reception</a> for the anime was mixed.</p><p>In a recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with IGN,</a> producer Adi Shankar spoke at length about details regarding the upcoming Devil May Cry: The Animated Series. According to Adi, the scripts for Season 1 are officially completed.</p><p>"They are rad," he told IGN. "I could not be more excited."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Capcom</span></figure><p>Adi also revealed that the series is being set up for multiple seasons, with the first season lasting eight episodes. He also confirmed that Vergil and the gun-savvy Lady will appear in the show. He went on to cheekily assure that <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a>, who's been announced to be voicing several classic characters in animated adaptations, won't be involved in the Devil May Cry show.</p><p>If the inclusion of Vergil and Lady are any indication, the first season might adapt the events of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening. Widely regarded as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the best games in the series</a>, DMC 3 is an origin story that depicts how Dante first opened his shop and explores the sibling rivalry between him and Vergil.</p><p>Unfortunately, Adi did not provide any solid release date for the series. But according to him, the studio plans to go into production in early 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbK3tctmpJqxXZi%2FunnAp6CmmaSasW6%2FxKugnqtdp7KtscCsnGackamy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-he-jeopardy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew He From Jeopardy!: Let's Re-Meet Him</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1426950-susan-crows-biography-tony-bennetts-wife-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Susan Crows bio: All you need to know about Tony Bennett's wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
