While her public image is of an aloof woman floating above the political gamesmanship of Washington, behind the scenes Melania Trump is not only part of President Trump’s inner circle, but for some key decisions she has been his single most influential adviser.”</p><p>Despite interviewing over 100 people, the first lady does not confirm any of the opinions or stories written in the book.

She claimed that the delay was due to her son, Barron, and his schooling in New York City, but now there is speculation that there was something else going on.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Washingto</u><u>n </u><u>Post</u></a>, "Jordan reveals in a new book that the first lady was also using her delayed arrival to the White House as leverage for renegotiating her prenuptial agreement with President Trump."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The book alleges that Melania’s mood improved once the new prenup was finalized.</h2><p>According to the book, which The Washington Post teased, that following the tarnishing negativity of her husband's campaign, including the infamous leaked Access Hollywood tape and multiple affair allegations, she needed a break from the spotlight and time "to amend her financial arrangement with Trump — what Melania referred to as ‘taking care of Barron.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Melania and her son moved to the White House <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in June 2017</a> — an entire five months after Donald Trump moved in, and the following year, many noticed her mood had improved.
