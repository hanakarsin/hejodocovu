One family in California has another neighbor horror story to add to the collection and we really feel for them. Especially since their bad apple of a neighbor is now dragging their kids into it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span><p>Stock photo</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A California mom shares video of her neighbor trespassing on her property, ripping the family's security camera out, then making vulgar remarks. That's just one of offenses, though.</h2><p>In a series of TikTok videos, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@tanyaguev2</a> discussed the lengths that her neighbor had taken. In one video, her neighbor is seen ripping a video camera from under @tanyaguev2’s roof. Once the neighbor gets a hold of it, she throws it in @tanyaguev2's driveway and begins calling @tanyaguev2 explicit names while giving her the middle figure.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tanyaguev2 href=#>@tanyaguev2</a><p>Im so over it. Called the cops and every time “theres nothing we can do, best thing would be for you to move out”. <a title=crazy href=#>#crazy</a> <a title=neighbor href=#>#neighbor</a> <a title=racism href=#>#racism</a> <a title=moveout href=#>#moveout</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Tanyaguev2" href=#>♬ original sound - Tanyaguev2</a></figure><p>In a different video, @tanyaguev2 explains more of her neighbor’s hostile behaviors.</p><p>"She has a camera pointing into my living room. She has a screen door and she will just sit there and yell at us when we go outside," @tanyague explained, adding, "She has recorded my kids in the little swimming pool in my front yard."</p><p>But that’s not all.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tanyaguev2 href=#>@tanyaguev2</a><p>Her property management has been nothing but nice to me but I know there is very little they can do because of the laws protecting tenants.

The neighbor also called the cops to tell them that @tanyaguev2's children were left unattended, which @tanyaguev2 says wasn’t true. Not to mention that all of this still happened despite the fact that @tanyaguev2 has a restraining order against this woman.</p><p>"We don't feel comfortable going outside in our own home," @tanyaguev2 explained.</p><p>What incited this neighbor’s hostile behavior toward @tanyaguev2 is unclear but it seems to be rooted in racism.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tanyaguev2 href=#>@tanyaguev2</a><p>Her property management has been nothing but nice to me but I know there is very little they can do because of the laws protecting tenants.

She's told me she wants to fight me," @tanyaguev2 continued.</p><p>@tanyaguev2 also noted that her family’s security camera — the one that the neighbor ripped from her property — does not look into her neighbor's yard, and the police even verified it. But on the other hand, the neighbor’s camera does invade @tanyaguev2 and her family’s privacy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tanyaguev2 href=#>@tanyaguev2</a><p>Here is some proof of that day that the camera wasn’t always poonting her way until that day. I repeat we dont even allow our kids to go outside because we are aftaid something can happen. We havent been able to enjoy our home because of her. Im trying everything I can to give her consequences to her actions. Shes clearly not okay and she needs help. <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=crazy href=#>#crazy</a> <a title=crazyneighbor href=#>#crazyneighbor</a> <a title=help href=#>#help</a> <a title=cops href=#>#cops</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Tanyaguev2" href=#>♬ original sound - Tanyaguev2</a></figure><p>Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an easy fix to @tanyaguev2's neighbor drama. While the neighbor rents, she and her husband own their house and understandably don't want to have to leave. However, @tanyaguev2 shared that the cops have suggested that the best thing she and her husband can do is move.</p><p>Furthermore, @tanyaguev2 shared that because of laws in California, it's easier said than done for her neighbor to get evicted.</p><p>Sending love to @tanyaguev2 and her family. Everyone deserves to feel at peace both inside and outside their home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7Kqs8ebpqtllJrAtb7Osqpmq5WYwrO107JknJmdmr%2Bivw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1199496-23-kinds-fruits-names-taste-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>23 kinds of fruits and their names everyone should taste</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-tannehill-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Tannehill - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
