There are a lot of things that he did that we didn’t hear about. This railway line that he did that Amaechi finished, he started it, agriculture, he had Adesina then but he didn’t have good PR. He did roads, and power amongst others.</p><p>“I am not saying he was a good president or a bad president, I’m not even judging him. This present government used that against him and brought him down. When they brought him down, what did he do? He left with integrity. People are the ones hailing him now that he has no business going back there cos when he was there, we abused him.</p><p>“We cannot say there was no fault in his government, we cannot. The people that he wants to go and stand on their back to become president again are the same people that brought him down.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FvZmtoYmh6q7vNmquhmZ5iwKaxyqKloGWjqr2xu9GtZKieXaWysLzLnmSwoJ9ir7O71KCfrWWYnrpusM6wpWaxlaO2brfUraBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./66385-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pope Sends Warning Message To Boko Haram, Kidnappers And Arms Dealers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-wipeout-contestant-die.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Did the 'Wipeout' Contestant Die?
