There are always a few stunning looks as well as a couple of terrible misfires, but this year, there was additional controversy after a photo circulated on social media suggesting that <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> and <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a> had worn the same dress to the event.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Photoshop leads to a fake rumor.</h2><p>Even as social media was buzzing about the looks from people like Billie Eilish, Kim Kardashian, and yes, Jared Leto, there was also a rumor floating around that JLo and Vanessa had inadvertently shown up in the same dress. The dress, which was designed by Moschino, is a black floor-length sheer gown that features a lace bodice, a long train and puffy sleeves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>A post on Twitter suggested that the two were both wearing the dress, but it eventually became clear that the photo of JLo wasn't real. Instead, someone had taken a photo of Vanessa Hudgens, who actually did wear the dress, and photoshopped JLo's head onto the image. If you look closely at the image of JLo, it's not that hard to tell that her face has been photoshopped, but the image did manage to fool plenty of people.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">JLo wasn't even at this year's Met Gala.</h2><p>Some people may have been convinced that JLo and Vanessa wore the same thing to the Met Gala, but in reality, JLo wasn't even in attendance this year. Neither she nor her new fiancé <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> were in attendance, although she didn't make it clear why she had chosen to skip out on the event. JLo did show up for last year's Met Gala, and wore a beaded Ralph Lauren neck gown that featured a sizable slit.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Met Gala was relatively controversy free.</h2><p>Other than the confusion around JLo and Vanessa, there was relatively little controversy surrounding this year's Gala. There was, of course, the usual clamoring on social media about wealthy elites who dress in occasionally ridiculous garb that looks like it came straight from The Hunger Games, but that accompanies the Met Gala every year.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jlo’s head is very clearly photoshopped here and if you don’t believe me tell me why she has the exact same accessories as vanessa… <a href=#>#MetGala</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EtrQaIXr4D</a></p>— alexandra nikolajev (@lexniko) <a href=#>May 3, 2022</a></figure><p>It's true, of course, that the Met Gala is a very obvious display of wealth, and that celebrities do often wear insane clothing to the event. Ultimately, though, the Met Gala is not the horrible display of power that many perceive it to be.</p><p>The Hollywood celebrities that are in attendance are certainly wealthy, but they have nothing on the billionaires who run many of the world's largest companies.</p><p>Creating a more equal world isn't about making sure that celebrities can't dress however they want, it's about making sure that those who have more money than they can ever spend are taxed appropriately. You can get mad about out of touch elites wearing funny clothes, but, with the exception of occasional attendee Elon Musk, these are not the wealthiest people on the planet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7mwecCnm2aukaOytL%2FAZp%2BunJeau7R50pqknmWUp7K0v4ymnK1ll5a5og%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-olise-may-join-chelsea-or-man-city-this-summer-report.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Olise May Join Chelsea Or Man City This Summer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./420-events-near-me.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here Are the Chillest Celebrations to Ring in 4/20 This Year</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
