For me, talking about it helps me," Groark told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courier Post</a>.<p>One day, right as he was starting his 2nd period class, he saw an envelope on his desk addressed to him - a gift from his students. Groark expected a simple gesture from his students.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure>"I thought it would be a card and a note, with maybe a Dunkin' Donuts gift card," Groark said.<p>However, the die-hard Philadelphia 76ers fan was blown away by what he found in the envelope - a touching message from his students along with two tickets to watch his favorite basketball team play.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Last month, our gym teacher‚Äôs wife had her 5th miscarriage 4 months into her pregnancy.
