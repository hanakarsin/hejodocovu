That spirited ‚Äî and sometimes angry ‚Äî style of leadership may have taken root when he played football in the NFL.</p><p>Indeed, the winning coach wasn't always wearing headphones and calling plays.</p><p>The Texas native formerly played in college at Texas A&M. From there, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan was drafted</a> to the New York Giants, where he played tight end from 1999‚Äì2002.

He finished his NFL playing career in 2009 with the <a href=#>New Orleans Saints</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, the super high-energy leader spent time coaching other teams he used to play for, including the Saints.
