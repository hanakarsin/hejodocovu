Sadly, their relationship ended a year later. Since then, Lira moved on and began a new relationship with another major player in the music industry, but unlike Rick Ross, he’s not a rapper. In late 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lira Galore</a> confirmed that she was pregnant. But who was her baby daddy?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lira Galore and her baby daddy have had a rough romantic history.</h2><p>Rumors of Lira Galore’s relationship with her baby daddy, Quality Control CEO Pierre “Pee” Thomas, were confirmed in 2018 when Lira announced that she was expecting a bundle of joy on Instagram. She wrote, “I chose to keep you a secret because I had to protect the energy I was exposing you to.”</p><p>She added, “On this day Christmas 2018 I’m ready to tell everyone about you because this is THE greatest gift. Even though Daddy and I planned you and made you out of love, when I first learned that you were really coming I still was unsure and scared about bringing you into the horrors of this world.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shortly after her announcement, fans also learned that Pee had allegedly cheated on Lira with former associate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaylar Will</a>, who was also expecting a child with the music executive. Although the two appeared to be engaged, in a series of Instagram stories, Lira blasted him for his infidelity and accused him of taking back his engagement ring.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She wrote, "I'm tired of being bullied and disrespected when I've been nothing but nice to you and respected those around you. I never asked for none of the money, cars, bags ... These are all things you came at me with!”&nbsp;</p><p>She added, “I opened my heart up to accepting your kids and your extended family so what you won't do is continue to treat me like you haven't cried tears to me about how thankful you are to have me and for trying to help you work on you and the demons and issues you are battling wishing yourself."</p><p>Kaylar and Lira later welcomed children one month apart, but Lira and Pee’s problems didn’t end after giving birth to their daughter, Khaleesi Aurora.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lira Galore previously sued her baby daddy, Pee, for abuse.</h2><p>A year after Lira and Pee’s social media spat, Lira Galore accused the Quality Control CEO of abusing her while she was pregnant and neglecting their daughter while she was in his care. While Pee had previously kept his comments off of social media, he took to Instagram to vehemently deny Lira’s claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with accusing Lira of having a cocaine addiction, he also released a series of text messages that he claimed were from Lira.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He captioned an Instagram post, “One thing I don’t play about is my father hood [sic]. I have 16 artist [sic] on my label, I still make time to see my children four times out of the week. The only women I leave my children with are there [sic] mothers and the women I was engaged with.”</p><p>Along with being embroiled in a bitter custody battle, Pee was later fined for violating a court order that prohibited either party from discussing the case on social media. A judge later ruled that the texts posted by Pee had been altered with “false comments.” Pee was ultimately ordered to pay an $11,000 fine in addition to Lira’s lawyer fees.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobazrYygmKWnopp6o63BsmSdmZSZxg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ibn-saud-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ibn Saud - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-margaret-josephs-leaving-rhonj.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Margaret Josephs Leaving RHONJ?
