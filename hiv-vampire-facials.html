She went on to urge anyone who received an injection at the clinic between March and September 2018 to get tested. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Testing is important for everyone as there are effective treatments for HIV and many hepatitis infections," Kunkel said.&nbsp;</p><p>“While over 100 VIP Spa clients have already been tested, NMDOH is reaching out to ensure that testing and counseling services are available for individuals who received injection related services at the VIP Spa,” she continued</p><p>Free testing sites have been set up at the South Valley Health Commons and Casa de Salud Family Medical Office, both located in Albuquerque.&nbsp;</p><p>NMDOH urges anyone undergoing cosmetic procedures that involve needles to ensure they're being carried out by a licensed medical professional.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnba3edWapKmhopp6p63Copilqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./valentine-blood-shall-flow-tonight-mike-bamiloye-raises-alarm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Valentine: Blood Shall Flow Tonight</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1099784-ipob-honour-killed-war-12-noon-may-30-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>IPOB to honour those killed during the war at 12 noon on May 30</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
