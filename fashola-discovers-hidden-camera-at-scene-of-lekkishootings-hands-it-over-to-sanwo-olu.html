She also displayed some of the bullet shells allegedly picked up from the scene of the shooting <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a video</a></strong> where she recounted her ordeals from the night.</p><p>Bodies of those reportedly shot are also yet to be found.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe5FuZp%2BZo528ra2MnaCsm5%2BrsrO%2FjKGgnZyVo3qkrcyeqZplkal6tK%2FEp5xmp5Ziuaa3yqKqoaefqbavs9Jmn5qmlKh6qsCMqK2eql2pvG6%2FwKeuqGWfocJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./landon-barker-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Landon Barker - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./650508-photos-president-buhari-talks-queen-elizabeth-ii-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Buhari Talks With Queen Elizabeth II</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
