The Wall Street Journal reporter was covering the "Russian mercenary group Wagner, which has taken part in some of the heaviest fighting in eastern Ukraine," when he was detained, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>.</p><p>Mikhail Gershkovich and Ella Milman were hopeful their son would soon be home, but a July 2024 guilty conviction undoubtedly deflated them. Here's what we know about his parents, as well as what Russia believes he did.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Evan Gershkovich's parents escaped Russia over 40 years ago.</h2><p>It was no accident that Gershkovich was working in Russia. After all, he's the son of two Russian immigrants. Mikhail and Ella fled their home country in 1979 due to the rampant antisemitism they faced as Jewish people living in the Soviet Union, reported the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>. Though they did this separately, they managed to find each other in America.</p><p>The couple met in New York while working as computer programmers at the same company. They eventually moved to Princeton, N.J. where they raised Evan and his sister Danielle as American-born but culturally Russian, which is how they viewed themselves. They ate Russian food, watched Russian programs, and even spoke Russian at home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Evan Gershkovich married?</h2><p>By all accounts, Evan is single, but he has many friends supporting him from all over the world. When his incarceration hit the one-year mark, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a> spoke to his closest friends who lamented the year of his life he had lost.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Evan's friends fill him in on all the big and small things happening in their lives via letters. One of his friends is Pjotr Sauer, a reporter at The Guardian who lives in London. He told Pjotr this was going to be his year of sports. His photo was included at a wedding Evan was supposed to attend. They are trying to keep him with them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Evan Gerhkovich do?</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>, Evan was falsely accused of "gathering information about a Russian defense contractor on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency" while working in Yekaterinburg, which is about 900 miles east of Moscow. He was charged with espionage.</p><p>In a secret trial that took place in July 2024, Evan was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in a high-security penal colony. President Biden said Evan was "targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American," and has promised to keep advocating for his release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsOiuoygnKurmKC8t7XCoWSpmaKau7W%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-presidency-ikpeazu-hosts-pdp-governors-in-abia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ikpeazu Hosts PDP Governors In Abia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./twilight-returns-to-theaters-tenth-anniversary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Twilight Returns to Theaters for Its 10th Anniversary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
