However, fans are now looking forward to watching and participating in the tournament online. The lineup, which was announced earlier this year, has garnered quite a bit of controversy, but there's one thing most gamers are looking forward to.</p><p>For the first time ever, <a href=#>Evo will be featuring the popular 2D fighting game Skullgirls</a>, which is incredibly monumental for avid fans of the game worldwide.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Introducing Evo Online! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ecf8gxNGUW</a></p>â€” EVO (@EVO) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What is 'Skullgirls'?</h2><p>If you aren't already familiar with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skullgirls</a>, let us bring you up to speed â€”&nbsp;according to Steam, it's a quick 2-D fighting game that debuted back in 2012, which challenges players to control intense fighters in a world called Dark Deco. Longtime fans claim it challenges even those well-versed in fighting game, but it's also quite accessible to newbies as well.</p><p>Skullgirls 2nd Encore, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released back in July 2015 to PlayStation 4 and Playstation Vita,</a> is now available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita, according to Fandom.

Others thought it could be because it's praised more for its storyline than its fighting. Either way, fans are excited it's going to be there â€”&nbsp;see what they had to say about its official debut, below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Skullgirls being at Evo is the recognition this game deserves ðŸ”¥ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3R3Hm5jBJV</a></p>â€” Shadow Yuk (@ShadowYuk) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SMASH GOT DROPPED AND SKULLGIRLS IS AT EVO ONLINE 2020</p><p>SKULLGIRLS STAY WINNING <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LXXiAaYZqB</a></p>â€” ðŸ”¥ Deri ðŸ”¥ (@OfWyvernsHeart) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't believe it took a global pandemic to finally get Skullgirls at EVO.</p>â€” A Bad Idea (@SP_A_Bad_Idea) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">'Super Smashbros Ultimate,' however, was removed from the lineup.</h2><p>A few weeks after Evo cancelled its physical tournament in Las Vegas, fans were thrilled to hear they would still be holding an online tournament.
