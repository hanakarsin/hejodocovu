You pick the brands that you like, the sauces, the butter (if you're using that) everything. If you have food allergies, then you're probably no stranger to preparing your own meals too.</p><p>However, there are some sources online that contend there are instances where getting someone else to make your food could be cheaper, especially if you're fine with continually eating fast food fare from a local place that's running a special on particular items you can nab for a bargain. And while this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">notion has been challenged</a>, there's now an anecdotal situation from a TikToker that might support the theory eating, in some cases, could be better for your wallet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@daniellewal2468 href=#>@daniellewal2468</a><p>Going out to eat might be cheaper than groceries at this point <a title=publix href=#>#publix</a></p><a title="♬ Follow me - Quandale Dingle" href=#>♬ Follow me - Quandale Dingle</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @daniellewal2468</span></figure><p>TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@daniellewal2468</a> posted a now-viral clip of her in her car where she shows off a bag of groceries.

We should've just gone to Chipotle lol"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @danielleawal2468</span></figure><p>Americans, on average, waste <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">30-40% of food annually</a>, or about $161 Billion worth of products. It's important to note that this is a general number and doesn't necessarily account for food thrown out by customers who have already purchased it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @danielleawal2468</span></figure><p>To that end, however, some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">80% of Americans</a> end up discarding otherwise fine-to-eat food after they've purchased it. While it can be argued that the TikToker in question certainly ended up buying more food than she would've gotten at Chipotle for $36, it could be that like many of us, the next time she plans on making a meal that necessitates any of the items she just purchased, they'd have either spoiled or the quantities aren't enough, which will require yet another trip to the supermarket.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @danielleawal2468</span></figure><p>That, itself takes time out of one's day, not to mention the time it takes to prepare the meal, too.</p><p>If you've got a hankering for a fried chicken sandwich, however, there are some folks online who've done a lot of legwork, recipes included, on how to make it for much cheaper than the $36 @daniellewal2468 spent to make them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @danielleawal2468</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Cheap Eats</a> published a recipe for a chicken sandwich that they estimate comes out to about $1.60 a sandwich when followed accordingly.

Some took her post as an affront to Publix, while others acquiesced that the chain has been known to have some pretty high prices depending on the items one's purchasing. Others suggested that she just purchase the grocery store chain's ready-made sandwiches.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @danielleawal2468</span></figure><p>And then others said while the store is pricier than other grocery options, that the "atmosphere and customer service and food is top tier."</p><p>Then there were those who said that she's probably just not shopping correctly if she's spending that much money to make a chicken sandwich, Publix visit or not.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @danielleawal2468</span></figure><p>What do you think?
