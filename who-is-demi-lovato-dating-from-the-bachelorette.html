During Hannah Brown’s season of The Bachelorette, singer <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> was not shy about voicing her opinion on who her favorite contestant was on social media. And, don't worry, Hannah gave the "Sorry Not Sorry" artist her "blessing" to pursue one of her former "boyfriends."&nbsp;</p><p>So, who is Demi reportedly dating from The Bachelorette? Well, Mike Johnson seems to have stolen her heart. After Mike was eliminated from Hannah’s season, he tweeted that he was still searching for his “future wife.” Deciding to throw her name into the mix, Demi tweeted: “I'M RIGHT HERE MIKE I’M RIGHT HERE BOO MY MOM ALREADY LOVES YOU TOO.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, are Demi Lovato and Mike Johnson from The Bachelorette officially dating?</h2><p>Fans are totally shipping this relationship! The pair has been exchanging flirty messages on social media all summer. Most recently, Mike commented on Demi’s sultry unedited bikini pic on Sept. 5., writing, “Look at me like that again. Love yaself [sic].”</p><p>So, have the two taken the next step in their cyber relationship? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, the 27-year-old singer and BIP star “did go on a date and it’s been going well.” The source added: “They seem to have a lot in common and are just enjoying getting to know each other.” &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Before his big date, Mike spoke with the outlet about his thoughts on the attention he’s received from the singer. “It made me feel sexy. It made me feel good. It’s pretty awesome; it’s pretty cool — I’m not gonna deny it,” he said. “She is still a human being, just like I am, and if we were to meet up, I’m not gonna be giddy at all. I’m [going to be like], ‘What’s up, sexy? You got a nice little booty on you. Let’s talk.’”</p><p>We have to wonder if that truly was Mike’s opening line on his date with Demi…&nbsp;</p><p>While the couple may be in the early stages of their romance, another Bachelorette star and celebrity duo that has fans in a tizzy is Tyler and Gigi’s relationship. The couple has been photographed together numerous times throughout the summer. He even supported his girlfriend at her grandmother’s funeral in The Netherlands. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Hey, maybe Mike is even picking up a few celebrity dating tips from his pal. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, “Tyler is happy. Tyler is good.” Adding: "[Gigi is] beautiful, she is. But what I talk to him about is, 'Bro, what are you doing? Like, how are you getting your abs?' "Literally, that's what I talk to Tyler about."&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from talking about Tyler’s abs, the friends also seem to be planning a double date. On Sept. 5, Mike commented on the model’s hunky shirtless pic, writing: "So if we do this dbl date, your shirt stays on [sic].” Seriously, this needs to happen… &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ2dnZ56rbvVmquoZZSWwaq6xmadq6edYsGpsYybmJyglaG8s7HTrZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dolly-rose-campbell-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dolly-Rose Campbell - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./west-wilson-summer-house-job.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>West Wilson From 'Summer House' Has a Cool Job</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
