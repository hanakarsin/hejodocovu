Her fascination with his songs came from her mother, Marion, who was also a huge fan of the renowned jazz musician.</p><p class=align-left>When talking about their meeting, Tony remembers how Susan went to one of his concerts when she was just nineteen, an event that would later trigger the beginning of their relationship. Susan had put in a request to say hello to the famous singer backstage after the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0944098cc41d7e8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bella Lambert’s biography: age, height, husband, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When the request was sent to Tony, it excited him that someone of Susan's age was so interested in his music.
