We are working on the inside to address whatever dissatisfaction or disaffection some of our aggrieved members have.</p><p>“On the other side, the PDP is completely trapped in the abyss of crisis for which I don’t expect them to emerge between now and the elections. They have almost singlehandedly inflicted that harm on themselves because that is the nature, the internal contradictions of that party.</p><p>“We need someone now who has the capacity, competence, the will and that whole presence of mind to enact this era that is coming.”</p><h2>How Insecurity Worked Against Jonathan</h2><p>The APC spokesperson during the interview had earlier stated that the insecurity in the country made it easier for his party to defeat <strong>Goodluck Jonathan</strong> who was the sitting President in 2015.</p><p>He however said the <strong>Muhammadu Buhari</strong> administration has done a lot to tackle insecurity since coming into power.</p><p>Morka added that the APC candidate, <strong>Bola Tinubu</strong> is ready to continue and do more regards fighting all forms of insurgency in the country.</p><p>He said, “The first duty of government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. That is the first and intimate duty. Insecurity is a very serious concern not just to the current government but it is at the core of Asiwaju’s own thinking and programming.</p><p>“This government from where its coming inherited a humongous liability when it comes to security. We were not safe in 2015 and I think that was part of the impetus for the removal of the previous government. Now, this government has reclaimed a lot of ground that was lost.</p><p>“There is a whole lot of things that Asiwaju administration if elected will do. First is to create an atmosphere where productivity can take place. Part of his business is to stamp out terror or reduce it to a point where terror become insignificant in the way it affects our people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49sZqmcoGLBs63PqZydZZmjeqS%2ByKygrGWTlru1edGeqqikppp6qr%2FSrpysZZKas7C%2BxGZpaWpjYrKtscKtoKimXZa9pHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-obi-reacts-as-oyo-nnewi-supporters-goes-agog-in-obidient-rally.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Obi Reacts As Oyo, Nnewi Supporters Goes Agog In 'Obidient' Rally</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nbc-to-regulate-social-media-platforms-online-content-creators-others.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NBC To Regulate Social Media Platforms, Online Content Creators, Others</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
