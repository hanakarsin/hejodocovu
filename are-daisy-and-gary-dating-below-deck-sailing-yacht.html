But I did really enjoy how much speculation there was," Daisy shared in an exclusive interview with<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> E! News</a> when Season 3 first began in February 2022. "No, Gary and I are just friends."</p><p>The Irish stew noted that she has a "complicated friendship" with Gary, but that they certainly are not in a committed relationship.</p><p>"It's a complicated friendship. I don't think we're more than just friends. We're very affectionate people and we're very affectionate towards each other and care a lot about each other and we've been through a lot over the last two years," she said about their connection on Season 3. "I just think that just got a bit blurred."</p><p>She added that their shared fondness for one another is a main reason why they've kissed from time to time.</p><p>"Our relationship is very platonic. We care about each other and like I said we're both affectionate people, so affection can sometimes lead to kissing," she added. "But no, we're just friends."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Chef Marcos Spaziani, Daisy Kelliher, and Gary King</p></figure><p>During the same discussion with E! News, Gary reiterated Daisy's words about their friendship. He also shared that he felt a spark with Daisy when they both joined Parsifal III in Season 2 — which may come as a surprise to longtime viewers.</p><p>"I thought she was very cute, I loved her personality and then nothing really matured out of it," he said about his first impression of his co-star.</p><p>"And I think she kind of knew this, so when we were in the jacuzzi it was just us alone, there was definitely chemistry there. I think we both felt it," he said. "And then one thing led to another and a few minutes later we were kissing, which for me was amazing, I don't know what Daisy says about. But it's a work in progress this relationship and we're just trying to build it step by step and see where it takes us."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gary and Daisy clarified their relationship status again on the Season 3 reunion.</h2><p>During the reunion special, which aired on Bravo on June 27, the co-stars confirmed, once again, that they are not together romantically. Though Gary was actually staying at Daisy's apartment in London when the reunion taped, the co-stars are still simply just pals.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Daisy (@daisykelliher87)</a></p></figure><p>"We're good friends," Daisy said, before adding that she no longer regretted their hot tub kiss.</p><p>Later on in the episode, a fan asked if Gary would be able to admit that he hides his real feelings for Daisy through jokes.</p><p>"Perhaps there could be some truth in that," the First Mate said, before Daisy responded, "Whatever."</p><p>The co-stars may not be a romantic item at the moment, but, given their chemistry, there's every chance that they'll both be back on the show next season.</p><p>Until then, you can stream Season 3 of Below Deck Sailing Yacht on Peacock now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecOaoKyxXZa7pXnGmqmyZZSWwaq6xmaZnqSfrHqlscKkZKyZmaG2r7OMspicoKQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./403670-grateful-sa-lady-finds-thanks-angel-who-bought-her-mom-groceries-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grateful woman finds and thanks angel who bought her mom groceries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./255573-uchungu-na-ghadhabu-nairobi-msanii-wa-muziki-apotea-na-kutafutwa-bila-mafani-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Uchungu na Ghadhabu Nairobi, Msanii wa muziki apotea na kutafutwa bila mafanikio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
