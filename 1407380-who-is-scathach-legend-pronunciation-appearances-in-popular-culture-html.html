There are a lot of legends surrounding this enigmatic personality. Who is she, and why is her story so exciting?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/abeb5ef6384724fb.jpg><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">history of Scathach</a> traces back to many centuries ago. She is a traditional Celtic figure whose mesmerizing tale is being told from person to person for many years.</p><h2>Who is Scathach?</h2><p class=align-left>This mythical figure is a Celtic warrior woman who lived sometime in 200 BC, according to the legends. She resided in her fortress on the Isle of Skye.</p><p class=align-left>In the Gaelic language, her name is translated to "The Shadowy One". As a notable warrior, she taught the new generation of heroes and was widely respected as a teacher.</p><h3>Scathach pronunciation</h3><p class=align-left>Since the name of this mythical female Celtic warrior might be a bit hard to pronounce, a lot of people are wondering about the correct <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Scáthach pronunciation.</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6cf5b7a69aecb977.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Of rust and gold: Man captures beautiful but rusty roofs of Ibadan buildings in viral photos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This word has some interesting etymology behind it, as it translates to "shadowy"; therefore "scath" means shadow, while "ach" is a suffix. At the same time, the word "scath" possesses a slightly different meaning, as it embodies protection or shield; this means that Scathach carries a meaning of "the one who protects".</p><p class=align-left>The word is pronounced as "skah-hahk". It is quite similar to the way you say "sky hawk", yet it has a few differences.</p><p class=align-left>First of all, instead of a "Y" in "sky," you have to say "ah". Additionally, instead of the "aw" in "hawk", you will also need to say "ah".</p><p class=align-left>Hopefully, this Scáthach pronounce guide helped you to understand how to say this word.</p><h3>Scáthach: the story</h3><p class=align-left>The legend about this famed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celtic female warrior</a> indicates that she lived around 200 BC. She was a warrior queen and had a fortress of her own, which was called Dún Scáith (translated to Castle of Shadows).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2a7541363c702cf1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 female anime characters every anime fan knows and loves</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6cf5b7a69aecb977.jpg><p class=align-left>The stories about her take place in the Red Branch Cycle, which is a collection of medieval legends about Irish heroes. This collection is one of the four greatest cycles which contain the old Irish myths.</p><p class=align-left>Some accounts recall that this woman was the daughter of the King of Scythia. She was a martial arts teacher who trained the young warriors, although she only took those who already had skills under her wing. Additionally, they had to pass a bravery test, which was penetrating the defences of her fortress.</p><p class=align-left>She trained her students in such aspects as pole vaulting (which was a useful skill to have in the assault of fortresses) and underwater fighting. Her trainings were also known to contain the element of combat with the gae bolg, which was a barbed harpoon that she herself invented.</p><h3>Is Scathach a goddess?</h3><p class=align-left>Some accounts report that she was also a master magician who had a prophecy gift. According to them, she became the goddess of the dead in Celtic mythology and overlooked people who fell in battles on their way to the Land of Eternal Youth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/48faca35bf4b4012.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rare and beautiful Kazakh girl names: list</span></p></a><h3>Scathach's best student</h3><p class=align-left>The most famed out of this warrior's students was Cu Chulainn, who she trained for a year. He learned many skills from her, which he then went on to incorporate in his battles and emerge victorious from them.</p><p class=align-left>The legendary hero had a backstory of falling in love with Emer, the chieftain's daughter. However, her father gave him the condition that he will only marry her if he completes his warrior training.</p><p class=align-left>Consequently, Cu Chulainn travelled to Skye together with his companion Ferdiad. There, they met Scathach, who trained them as warriors and shared her barbed spear, the gae bolg, with Cu Chulainn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2a7541363c702cf1.jpg><p class=align-left>During his training, Cu Chulainn also assisted Scathach in overtaking Aife, a chieftain who lived not far away from her and forced her to retreat from her plans of defeating her fellow warrior. Some accounts claimed that Aife and Scathach were sisters.</p><p class=align-left>It was also said that Cu Chulainn fathered a child with Aife. He also slept with Scathach's daughter Uathach and later proceeded to kill her husband in a duel. Additionally, there were records of him sleeping with the famed warrior herself after she completed his training.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/579e939c7c1d0dd7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing Oscar Wilde quotes that every literary fan should know</span></p></a><h3>Scathach in popular culture</h3><p class=align-left>This mythological figure has appeared in multiple books, movies, and video games.
