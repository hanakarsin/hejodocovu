Perhaps the most troubling casualty, however, is the cost of food. Restaurant prices jumped on average by 7.7%, with store-bought grocery items climbed up a whopping 11.4%, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with the USDA predicting even more increases to come in 2023</a>.</p><p>And while these price hikes are apparent to anyone, even if they are a frequent shopper seeing the increases occur incrementally, they'd be extremely jarring to someone who hasn't gone grocery shopping for a few years.</p><p>This is exactly what the TikTok account for Shelby & Dylan (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@shelbyanddyl</a>) documents. Shelby documents her and her husband, Dylan, as they walk into a grocery store where she captures his reactions to seeing what food products cost these days.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@shelbanddyl href=#>@shelbanddyl</a><p>3 years since inflation and he is just now realizing. <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=husbandreacts href=#>#husbandreacts</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=inflation href=#>#inflation</a> <a title=walmart href=#>#walmart</a> <a title=shopping href=#>#shopping</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Shelby & Dylan" href=#>♬ original sound - Shelby & Dylan</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>She writes in a text overlay of the video: "My husband just now finding out what groceries cost after inflation," as they walk through the parking lot of the supermarket.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>From the get go they're greeted by kids selling Girl Scout Cookies, which they purchase for $5 a box. Dylan is visibly excited. Inside the store, Dylan loads up the cart with some water, Pampers diapers are seen in the cart as well, and then the couple gets to the section with eggs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>"We need eggs," she says. While looking through the cartons and picking up the sunglasses that fell off of his head and onto the cartons in the fridge. After picking up some eggs, Dylan recoils in horror, "Shelby. is that how much they cost?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>Next up is a gallon of milk, "Are you sure you want to pay that?" he asks, extricating a gallon from the refrigerator. "We really need to get cows and chickens. Are you serious?"</p><p>She replies, "I always told you I wanted to live on a farm."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>"Yeah, well, you're gonna," he says, before picking up a pack of disposable plates. "$8 for styrofoam that I'm just gonna throw away?"</p><p>"Yep," she says, laughing.</p><p>"We washing these," he remarks as he puts the plates in the shopping cart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>The clip then cuts to him typing on his phone, Shelby asks him what he's doing. "I'm Googling...if I can wash styrofoam plates."</p><p>She then tosses a bag of chips into the cart and, again, he asks shocked if they normally cost that amount.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>The video then cuts to Dylan walking through another aisle in the store, pondering the economics of better eating: "How come the world wants you to eat healthier but they charge out the ying yang for healthy food. Just gonna be all fat and sassy."</p><p>He was shocked to see the price of ramen go up as well. "Back in the day you get a good pack of ramen for a quarter..."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>He then tells Shelby that she's going to have to breastfeed their kid until he's 18 years old. By the time they reach the check-out aisle, an intense look of concern washes over Dylan's face. He pays for the food, and once they're outside in the Walmart parking lot, he turns to his wife and asks, "Is that how much it usually is?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @shelbyanddyl</span></figure><p>"I'm doing the math in my head and I just don't see how this is possible. God is working miracles through our bank account right now. For us to be able to eat. That's the only explanation," he says.</p><p>"It's ridiculous," Shelby agrees. At the end of the clip, he busts out a famous Joe Exotic line, "We're never gonna financially recover from this."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLansYyrnJynopnAbrTUrJmappSoerOxwJyroqeeYsGwecinnaWZpJ68rw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-joshua-vs-francis-ngannou-kick-off-time-how-to-watch-prize-money.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kick-off Time, How To Watch, Prize Money</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Beyonce On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
