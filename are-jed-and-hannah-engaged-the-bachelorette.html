'Bachelorette' Fans Hope Not After Girlfriend Scandal</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Allison Cacich</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated July 17 2019, 5:22 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Remember when Hannah Brown sent a guy home on the first night of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelorette</a> because he had a girlfriend? Well, it looks like she also should’ve kicked a second man to the curb.</p><p><a href=#>Jed Wyatt</a>, the 25-year-old singer from Tennessee who admitted to Hannah that he initially came on the show to promote his music, allegedly had a girlfriend when he flew to California in March.&nbsp;</p><p>After learning the details, fans are worried that Hannah <a href=#>becomes engaged</a> to Jed in the finale, which may set up an explosive "After the Final Rose" if the former beauty queen is at all rocked by this scandal.</p><p>Scroll down for <a href=#>spoilers regarding Hannah and Jed</a>’s relationship and what the musician’s ex has to say about his alleged betrayal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Jed and Hannah engaged?</h2><p>Initially, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a> reported that Jed and Hannah were engaged, but after the news surfaced of his pre-show girlfriend, it looks like Hannah B. called off the engagement — and dumped Jed.&nbsp;Luckily, cameras were there to capture the breakup.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Hannah and Jed are done completely. She’s broken off the relationship altogether. She’s not trying or hoping for it to work out,"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> RS reported</a>. "They are done. And I can also report, their breakup was filmed in LA on camera and we will see that during Part 2 of the ATFR airing on July 30th."&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine, Nashville-based singer, Haley Stevens, claims that she and Jed had been dating for four months when he left to film The Bachelorette. The 26-year-old adds that he applied for the show before they began seeing each other.</p><p>"He said, 'It’s probably not going to happen, but it’s a huge opportunity. I’m only doing this for my music,'" Haley recalls. "He only did it for his career."</p><p>She alleges that he "only wanted to be top five … to be a major player so that it would be beneficial." But despite Jed telling Haley that he loved her after landing on the west coast, she never heard from him again.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Haley claims Jed "ghosted" her when he returned to Nashville.&nbsp;</h2><p>Bachelorette contestants have to surrender their phones upon entering the mansion, so Haley had no idea when her boyfriend would be coming back. "I bought a homecoming outfit that I was going to wear to maybe pick him up at the airport," she remembers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>But as the season began airing, Haley grew more anxious that he had fallen in love with Hannah after not hearing from him. "In the beginning I felt bad [watching the show] because I thought he loved me and was faking dating her," she admits. "But then I thought, my boyfriend could be engaged to someone else. Seeing him kissing her for the first time was the worst day."</p><p>She finally ran into him at a music venue earlier this month. "He said, 'Hey how have you been?' and I said, 'How do you think I’ve been?' I asked him, 'You didn’t think I deserved a phone call?' And he said, 'I didn’t know what to say.'"</p><p>Haley explains that she’s coming forward with her story in an effort to control the narrative after several outlets got wind of the relationship. "I thought it probably wasn’t going to work out. But the hardest part is that he ghosted me," she confesses.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I don’t believe he’s a terrible person, but it’s a terrible situation. And part of me thinks I was the backup plan and he wanted me to be here in case it didn’t work out. I feel 100 percent betrayed."</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how Jed tries to dig himself out of this hole.&nbsp;Watch new episodes of The Bachelorette every Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bmecmem2aZnpl6qa3Np5ihZZWjtKKzxJ1kraCVYq%2Bir8eeo6iqlanBpg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kogi-state.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Kogi state On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./super-falcons-of-nigeria-drop-in-fifa-world-ranking.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Super Falcons Of Nigeria Drop In FIFA World Ranking</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
