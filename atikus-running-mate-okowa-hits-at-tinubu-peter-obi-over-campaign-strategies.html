They have taken our country to the bottom. It’s a big shame. For us in the PDP, the onus rests on us to mend the cracks in our party. No external influence will do that for us. By the grace of God, we will reach a successful end so that we can move on.</p><p>“So long as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is as professional and neutral as it was in Osun and Ekiti states, I don’t see the APC winning the elections.</p><p>“Having been in politics from the grassroots, the state and national levels for over 40 years now, there’s no magic the APC can conjure to win in 2023.</p><p>“Some of their leaders who think they are powerful, have indirectly visited wickedness on the generality of our people in the name of being close to Aso Rock.”</p><p>Ortom alleged that some members of the APC prevailed over the federal government not to release funds to his state to pay salaries and pensions.</p><p>“We applied for a bailout of N42 billion from the federal government to enable us to offset long-standing arrears of salaries, pensions and gratuities. Some of these people scrambled to the state house to tell the president not to release the funds even after approval so that we will not take the credit for solving the age-long problem. This is the kind of mean-spirited attitude APC is inflicting on our people,”&nbsp;Ortom added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BsZpqsmaDCtHnRrqWnoZ6ceq6t055kqKOfrK5utMitqmaZpGLBqrrUm6xmqJWpsrN5zpugZqemmr9ur8Cmp5qhl6N6tMDRmquen5mawHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charlotte-summers-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charlotte Summers - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-ex-spokesman-ologbondiyan-narrates-what-made-wike-almost-suffer-heart-attack.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PDP Ex-Spokesman, Ologbondiyan Narrates What Made Wike Almost Suffer Heart Attack</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
