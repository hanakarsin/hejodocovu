Here's a rundown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What is the drama between Chris Colfer and Lea Michele?</h2><p>On Oct. 12, 2022, author and actor Chris Colfer appeared on The Michelle Collins Show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>. When the titular host asked if he would like to join her for a night out in New York City, Chris asked, "Oh no, are you seeing Funny Girl?" then added, "Oh. My day suddenly just got so full."</p><p>Chris attempted to move past the issue, saying, "I saw Six last night, and that was amazing."</p><p>However, Michelle pressed, asking, "So, you're not seeing [Funny Girl] is my guess, while you're in town?" And Chris responded, "No, I can be triggered at home."</p><p>As co-stars of the show Glee, Chris and Lea often did press events together. Most recently, they presented at the 26th annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party in 2018.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2020, Glee actress <a href=#>Samantha Ware accused Lea Michele</a> of on-set bullying and creating a toxic work environment after she tweeted her support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>Samantha responded, "LMAO REMEMBER WHEN YOU MADE MY FIRST TELEVISION GIG A LIVING HELL?!?! CAUSE ILL NEVER FORGET. I BELIEVE YOU TOLD EVERYONE THAT IF YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD 'S--- IN MY WIG'! AMONGST OTHER TRAUMATIC MICROAGGRESSIONS THAT MADE ME QUESTION A CAREER IN HOLLYWOOD..."</p><p style=text-align:start>Fellow former Glee stars Amber Riley and Alex Newell reacted to the accusations with memes in support of Samantha, seemingly implying not all was well on set.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>As a response, Lea issued a statement and apology in June 2020, promising to "be better." She said, "One of the most important lessons of the last few weeks is that we need to take the time to listen and learn about other people's perspectives and any role we have played or anything we can do to help address the injustices that they face."</p><p>She concluded, "Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult, I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused. We all can grow and change and I have definitely used these past several months to reflect on my own shortcomings."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Fellow Glee stars Jenna Ushkowitz and Kevin McHale were recently asked about how they felt regarding Lea's turn in Funny Girl during RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race. Both actors admitted they had not spoken to Lea "in a long time" but would potentially be open to seeing her run of the show.</p><p>Thankfully, it seems the upcoming Glee behind-the-scenes documentary may shed light into why the former co-stars aren't feeling the love for Lea Michele.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdJmmqiklpq%2FbrjEmmSmoZOdsq2xjJ2pmqWR</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clifford-irving-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Clifford Irving - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marcus-lemonis-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Marcus Lemonis' Net Worth and What Was His Early Life Like?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
