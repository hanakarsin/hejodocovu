The funnyman and host of The HoneyDew Podcast has made a name for himself thanks to his unique ability to shed comedic light on life's lowest points. He has been featured on the likes of The Joe Rogan Experience and Your Mom's House, appearances which have only gone on to solidify his position as one of the podcast world's funniest personalities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, the comedian is the one who has recently faced a low point in life after dealing with what could only be described as a harrowing situation. So, what happened to Ryan? Let's take a look at the known details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Ryan Sickler? Fans are concerned about his health after a recent string of hospitalizations.</h2><p>Ryan's followers were shocked when the personality took to Instagram on Jan. 5, 2023, to share an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">image</a> of him lying in a hospital bed. Alongside the photo, the comedian wrote, "After 35 years of pain I’m finally getting a backiotomy! See y’all on the other side! Hopefully…"</p><p>For context, a backiotomy is not a real procedure. It appears to be a quick-witted joke referring to a scene in the film Half Baked when Sir Smoke-A-Lot (Dave Chappelle) says, "The doctor said I need a backiotomy."</p><p>After sharing multiple images of himself in hospital beds over the weeks as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teasing</a> to fans on Twitter that he will elaborate more about what happened to him, Ryan finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> it all on Instagram on Jan. 27, 2023.</p><p>"After what was supposed to be a 'simple, three hour outpatient back procedure,' I’m finally home, resting. Because of a complication with the original procedure, I had to have a second emergency surgery," he wrote. However, the medical issues didn't end there.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ryan continued with, "While I was recovering from the 2nd surgery, I developed massive pulmonary embolisms in both of my lungs, on top of other major complications. I’ve been in the hospital for damn near a month, at times fighting for my life."</p><p>He added, "The outpouring of love and support has been truly overwhelming and beyond anything I expected. I’m going to spend this time now with family and friends, reflect on everything, and figure out what life is like moving forward."</p><p>The comedian's kind words concluded with a message: "Stay strong, hug your loved ones, and be good to the people who are truly there for you in your time of need."</p><p>Our thoughts are with Ryan as he continues to heal following this difficult situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrsZGjerS1wqSjnqo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./14219-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BREAKING NEWS: Ex-Oyo State Governor, Lam Adesina Is Dead</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./major-shakeup-in-nigerian-army-as-yahaya-redeploys-top-generals-full-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Major Shakeup In Nigerian Army As Yahaya Redeploys Top Generals (Full List)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
