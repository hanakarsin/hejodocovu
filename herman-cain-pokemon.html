He even references Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back in a 2011 speech where he bowed out of the race for the Presidency.&nbsp;</p><p>"Life can be a challenge. Life can seem impossible, it's never easy when there's so much on the line," he said at the time. "But you and I can make a difference. There's a mission just for you and me. Just look inside and you will find just what you can do."</p><p>He was quoting "The Power of One," a song from the 1999 movie that saw a wide theatrical release in the United States.</p><p>Herman had suspended his campaign among rumors that he was having an affair, but the Pokémon reference is what many remembered. The former chairman and CEO of Godfather's Pizza doubled down on his apparent love of pocket monsters when he commented on the phenomenon that was Pokémon Go! when the mobile game first launched in 2016.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here is Herman Cain's warning to Pokemon players. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5mh3CC6K8v</a></p>— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) <a href=#>July 19, 2016</a></figure><p>"The Pokémon Go game that they have — be careful out there. That’s all I can say. Because it’s been used to lure people into situations where they’ve been robbed. So be very careful out there. I think it is an excellent, brilliant, entertaining concept, but people have to be really careful," he said in a video interview with the Toronto Star.</p><p>In his suspension speech, he didn't go into details regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, however, he prefaced his quote by saying: "I believe these words came from the Pokémon movie. The media pointed that out. I’m not sure who the original author is. So don’t go writing an article about the point. But it says a lot about where I am, where I am with my wife and family, and where we are as a nation."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Herman Cain was the presidential candidate who quoted a song from Pokémon: The Movie 2000 as part of his campaign<br>(thx 4 reminding me <a href=#>@luigihann</a>)</p><p>I always liked the idea that he knew he was losing anyway so he did it on a dare.</p><p>And honestly?

Several outlets have pointed out the fact that Herman nor other rally attendees were wearing masks during the gathering. He was admitted to an Atlanta hospital on July 1, two days after testing positive for the coronavirus.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You're never ready for the kind of news we are grappling with this morning.

They wrote of his death, "Cain, who recently joined Newsmax TV and was set to launch a weekly show, died in an Atlanta-area hospital where he had been critically ill for several weeks. He was admitted on July 1, two days after being diagnosed with COVID-19."</p><p>Many are speculating that the Trump rally he attended is where he contracted COVID-19, and are pointing to his death as even greater evidence for the importance of donning face coverings.</p><p>Herman himself, in a now-deleted tweet, wrote, "Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump.
