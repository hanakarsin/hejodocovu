Almost instantly, fans thought of the controversial model’s family, especially her then-5-month-old daughter, <a href=#>Dannielynn Birkhead</a>.</p><p>Dannielynn was undoubtedly thrust into the chaotic world of tabloids from birth — from a paternity case between her father, <a href=#>Larry Birkhead</a>, and Anna Nicole’s lawyer and secret lover, <a href=#>Howard K. Stern</a>, to the dragged-out battle for her mother’s fortune.</p><p>Before Anna Nicole died, she fought for funds that her second husband, the late <a href=#>J. Howard Marshall</a>, reportedly promised her prior to his 1995 passing. Since her daughter is her sole heir, did Dannielynn get any money from Anna Nicole?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Anna Nicole Smith’s daughter get any money? In short, no.</h2><p>Anna Nicole’s net worth was reportedly $1 million when she passed away, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, Dannielynn received the estate when she was 18 months. The estate was originally in Anna Nicole’s son <a href=#>Daniel Wayne Smith</a>’s name, but he died at age 20, three days after Dannielynn’s birth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since Anna Nicole wrote in her 2001 will that the assets in Daniel's trust should be shared equally if she had more kids, Dannielynn reportedly received $700,000, and the court also named Larry and Howard as co-trustees. She was also entitled to any money Anna Nicole would’ve won from the Marshall family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Anna Nicole was awarded $474 million in a 2006 judgment but never received the money because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the decision, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. The Court of Appeals argued that the California court did not have jurisdiction to make such a ruling.</p><p>While Anna Nicole continued appealing the decision until she died, she ultimately never won anything, and neither did Dannielynn. However, in 2020, Howard gave Dannielynn Anna Nicole’s possessions, which he had kept in storage for 13 years.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Unfortunately, Howard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in legal documents</a> that the items were worth less than his storage costs, so the items likely have more sentimental value than financial. Still, Dannielynn <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly has a net worth</a> of $3 million, so she and Larry, who gained full custody of her in 2007, are likely doing just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecCnpZplnp6wsLjEZqqmoaSdeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrSmwIyapbJlnaS7psU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1435067-landon-mcbrooms-biography-austin-mcbrooms-brother-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Landon McBroom's biography: who is Austin McBroom's brother?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amine-rapper-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amin (Rapper) - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
