There was a bad guy that needed to be taken down and you'd go through a ton of challenges to do it. Sure, there were titles like Super Fire Pro Wrestling by Suda 51 and the Metal Gear series by Hideo Kojima, but titles usually didn't pack premises like 2021's <a href=#>Game of the Year, It Takes Two</a>, which many people want to see on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will 'It Takes Two' ever come to the Nintendo Switch?</h2><p>If you've been hoping to play the co-op only game on Nintendo's hit console, then we've finally got some good news: The title will be coming to the Switch on Nov. 4.</p><p>You'll be able to play with friends either using local wireless play or online. Just like with the PlayStation version, purchasing the game will give you an additional copy to send to a friend so they can play with you.</p><p>Nintendo has almost become synonymous with the term "family friendly video game." Even its more violent games, like the floaty Super Smash Bros. that features a litany of different video game characters beating the ever-loving snot out of one another, still manage to feel more like a kid creating a massive cross-over event with their toys, Who hasn't made their Ninja Turtles fight the Ghostbusters in a WWE ring with the Undertaker and a Quasimodo burger King Toy as the announcers?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>And while It Takes Two deals with some pretty heavy subject matter, its gameplay and aesthetic, while gnarly in its own respect, is extremely family-oriented. And an argument can be made that the emotional plot of the story is "family friendly" as well.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'It Takes Two' about?</h2><p>The game follows its two main characters, May and Cody who are on the brink of a divorce. Their daughter, Rose, accidentally transmits their souls into the bodies of dolls and the two must work together in order to return back to their humanity. The game's plot, however, has been criticized for taking a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reductionist approach</a> to the amelioration of relationships and the subject of divorce.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>corporate shills are so funny to me like... nintendo is not going to give you discounts on the switch eshop because you're flocking to twitter to whine about how it takes two flopped hardcore and "isn't even a family game"</p>‚Äî ruf || korekara mo zutto, zuttosa, issho ni...
