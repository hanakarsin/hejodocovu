In an attempt to help, they venture in. However, they quickly learn that once you go in, you don't come out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Patrick Wilson, Harrison Gilbertson, Laysla De Oliveira, and Avery Whitted.</p></figure><p>And after checking out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the movie trailer</a>, you're probably wondering, "who is Becky from In the Tall Grass?" She definitely has a familiar face, and there's a reason why.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Becky from In the Tall Grass? She's played by Laysla De Oliveira, who has several upcoming projects.</h2><p>Laysla has been working incredibly hard these last few months, so there's a chance you're already anticipating some of her latest projects.</p><p>According to Laysla's IMDB page, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her most recent projects</a> is playing Veronica in the upcoming Canadian drama Guest of Honour. In the film, she's working alongside esteemed actors such as Luke Wilson and David Thewlis (from Harry Potter).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>&nbsp;According to her IMDB page, Laysla will also star the upcoming comic-book-adapted-to-Netflix series, Locke & Key, as the role of Dodge in all 10 episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and if you're an Orlando Bloom fan (because really, who isn't?) Laysla will appear in his latest sci-fi project Needle in a Timestack as the role of Sibila. So that's definitely major.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Laysla has also worked on many completed projects.</h2><p>In addition to several indie short films such as Code 8, and Business Ethics, per Laysla's IMDB page, she has appeared in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than one CW show</a>.
