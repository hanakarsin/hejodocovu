The women were taking part in a cast trip to Vail, Colo., when they discovered what happened to Jen. (The arrest happened in March 2021 but aired on RHOSLC in November 2021.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The JXA Fashion owner’s co-stars have frequently discussed her arrest on RHOSLC. However, the topic of conversation soon turned to Meredith, who’s had several altercations with Jen throughout the years. But, the Meredith Marks store CEO shared if there’s any truth to those allegations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meredith Marks earned a law degree before joining ‘RHOSLC.’</h2><p>In a January 2022 episode of RHOSLC, while the ladies were in Zion, <a href=#>Whitney Rose</a> accused Meredith of calling authorities in hopes of getting Jen arrested. The claim came after Meredith and <a href=#>Mary Cosby</a> opted not to travel in the group's van while in Zion (just as they hadn't traveled in the group's van during the Vail trip).</p><p>Once Whitney noticed the pattern, she told Meredith that “​​it looks like you may have had something to do with the fact that Jen was indicted.”</p><p>Jen also stepped in and asked Meredith directly if she hired a private investigator before she got arrested.</p><p>Meredith vehemently denied having anything to do with her co-star’s arrest, calling Jen and Whitney’s claims “a revolting accusation.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, Meredith told E! News that her law background could’ve been what fueled the rumor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I'm not a practicing lawyer; I never have been a practicing lawyer, but I am a licensed lawyer, and I do have the background and the education,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> in 2021 when discussing the rumor about her alleged involvement in Jen's arrest. “So I think in some ways my knowledge of the law might have led people to believe that I knew more about this situation than they did or than the general public did, I guess.”</p><p>“I don't really know,” she continued. “But these things happen over time, and this was a federal investigation. It's not something that happens overnight; everything takes a long time with this. I guess you'll have to see how it all unfolds. For the record, I can say that I did not have anything to do with Jen's arrest."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did ‘RHOSLC’ star Meredith Marks go to law school?</h2><p>Per her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> page, Meredith attended law school at Northwestern University and graduated in 1997.</p><p>While attending Northwestern as a law student, Meredith also studied at their business school, Kellogg School of Management. Upon graduation, she launched a health club and worked as a real estate agent. However, Meredith changed careers after being “<a href=#>aggressively mugged</a>” when she and her family lived in Chicago. Eventually, she left her health club and real estate dreams behind and became passionate about jewelry.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Meredith’s love of jewels began when she was young, she launched her online boutique amid the 2009 recession. Since then, the <a href=#>Meredith Marks Store</a> has gained celebrity clientele such as Rihanna, Charlize Theron, and Courteney Cox.</p><p>The store has also been a discussion topic on RHOSLC. In Season 2, Meredith claimed one of Jen’s employees allegedly <a href=#>took something out of her store</a>. When the Shah Beauty owner decided not to fire the employee, Meredith declared, “That’s not my friend.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City airs Sunday nights on Bravo at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforKzscOiq6FlnZa%2FrL%2BMpZiwsZWn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./405270-kirinyaga-farmer-invents-shoes-cows-cushion-feet-sore-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kirinyaga farmer invents shoes for his cows to cushion them from footsore</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyond-scared-straight-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beyond Scared Straight - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
