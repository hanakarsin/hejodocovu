The contestant started to have chest pains sometime after completing the course. Although on-set medics treated the contestant and immediately transported him to a hospital, the contestant â€” whose name was Michael Paredes â€” ultimately died.&nbsp;</p><p>A TBS spokesperson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, "We are devastated to have learned of his passing, and our deepest sympathy goes out to the family."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did the 'Wipeout' contestant die?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC news</a> reported that the L.A. County coroner's office found that 38-year-old Michael Paredes' cause of death was natural causes "and that he suffered from undetected coronary artery disease." He sustained a heart attack after taking a fall on the series' obstacle course. He shortly lost consciousness following the spill and then died a day later after being rushed to a hospital in Santa Clarita, Calif.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>The coroner's toxicology report cleared Paredes of any alcohol or drugs in his system at the time of his death, however, the report did indicate he regularly used Nutrex Outlift Amped, a pre-workout powder. It's said that he consumed a mixture of the supplement with water prior to filming that day.</p><p>Paredes' autopsy report is not suggesting that the pre-workout had anything to do with or contributed to his passing. The distinction was made in order to clarify a false positive for MDMA (aka Ecstasy) that came up in the report. The contestant's fiancÃ©e told those investigating Paredes' death that he did not consume any drugs or alcohol and that he didn't feel any strange side effects after taking the workout supplement.</p><p>Sadly, this isn't the first tragedy associated with Wipeout. Another contestant died in 2009.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>'Wipeout' Contestant Dies in Hospital After Completing Obstacle Course <a href=#>https://t.co/gGcBHh8Hqy</a></p>â€” TMZ (@TMZ) <a href=#>November 20, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did 'Wipeout' contestant Tom Sparks die?</h2><p>Tom Sparks, who was 33, started having knee pain and experiencing shortness of breath while on-set for Wipeout in 2009. This was on Oct. 19. He was taken to a hospital, where he had multiple brain surgeries â€” but he died on Nov. 5 from a stroke.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to sources</a>, he had antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is a disease that causes extra and unnatural blood clots. It also wasn't known if he disclosed this information to the Wipeout producers (all candidates need to be forthcoming about their medical history and any pre-existing conditions before participating in the show).</p><p>Tom had just graduated from USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and had also just gotten married to his wife Kate, who was also on Wipeout.</p><p>"We offer our heartfelt condolences to the family.

The original series was on ABC for seven seasons between 2008 and 2014 for a whopping 130 episodes. The show was originally created by Matt Kunitz and Scott Larsen and filmed at Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, Calif.</p><p>Catch episodes of the new Wipeout series Thursdays at 9/8 c on TBS.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2avmaWysMHTZpqopqSawLWtza1knaGV</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-jonathan-seeking-support-of-people-who-brought-him-down-yeni-kuti.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Seeking Support Of People Who Brought Him Down Yeni Kuti</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-steamboat-willie-offensive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>'Steamboat Willie' Is Now Public Domain, but What Is Behind Its Complex History?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
