The couple first met in Rome at the Cavalieri hotel in 2015. Their first interaction was not exactly meet cute, as according to Serena Williams, she (and her friends) tried to get rid of him by claiming there was a rat nearby – this was after Ohanian sat in a table next to them. When that did not work, they invited him to join their table.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking to Vanity Fair</a>, Williams said that their lives were very different. Ohanian knew very little about tennis and had never even watched a tennis match before. On the other hand, Williams, despite being tech-savvy had never heard of Reddit. However, she invited him to her tennis match, and Ohanian agreed to attend. This was the beginning of their budding relationship, and soon, he would start to become a regular at her matches, rising to become her number one fan.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6386279f0a3e462e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder relationship explained</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ohanian and Williams went on their first official date in June 2015 during the French Open tournament.

The couple started dating but kept news of their relationship very quiet.</p><p class=align-left>However, Ohanian started attending Williams matches, including one in September 2015 during the US Open, where he posted her photo, leading to rumours of their relationship to start making headlines. By 2016, Ohanian had become a fixture at Williams matches. However, the couple still kept their relationship quiet (as far as social media goes) until late 2016, when Ohanian started appearing in Williams social media posts.</p><p class=align-left>Alexis Ohanian proposed to Williams on December 10, 2016, and in the same place, they had met in Rome. It was Williams who announced their engagement – and on a Reddit post. The announcement was comprised of a poem, which Williams herself had composed. She also gave herself the name “future Mrs Kn0thing” – Kn0thing being Ohanian’s Reddit handle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/dcda79253699b76f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Joya Tillem: the untold story of Jon Favreau's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Denzel Washington net worth according to Forbes</p><p class=align-left>In September 2017, the couple welcomed their first baby, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. Shortly afterwards in November, they got married in a lavish ceremony that took place at Contemporary Arts Center in New Orleans.</p><p class=align-left>During the wedding, Williams wore a designer gown, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a Sarah Burton</a>, which was accompanied by jewellry worth $3.5 million. The event was also attended by several celebrities, including Venus Williams (Williams sister), Kim Kardashian, Beyoncé, Ciara, Kelly Rowland, Eva Longoria, and others – and of course, their daughter. The couple celebrated their 1st anniversary in 2018.</p><h3>Alexis Ohanian's daughter</h3><p class=align-left>Ohanian’s and Williams first baby was unexpected. Williams found out about the pregnancy in January 2017 during the Australian Open, after a poor performance during her first match and subsequent practice sessions led her to take a pregnancy test.

However, when it comes to the tech world, Serena Williams husband is a star of his own. When he (and his partner) sold Reddit for an undisclosed amount, Ohanian joined the rank of millionaires, and he has continued to build his portfolio with his investments and work in the tech industry.</p><p class=align-left>As of December 2017, his net worth was an estimated $9 million. However, his net worth might have grown and could continue to grow more with Ohanian having returned to Reddit, a company that is now worth about $1.8 billion dollars. His career as a venture capitalist is another avenue that could see his net worth growing considerably in the coming years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/905b0d545cc17221.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jessie Holmes from Life Below Zero: career, net worth, wife, family, house, accident</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although some people only know him as Serena Williams husband, Alexis Ohanian is most famous for being the co-founder of Reddit.com.
