Now, he is in the opposition. You can’t take whatever he says as the gospel. The question is when former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar was in government with President Olusegun Obasanjo, where did they take the country?</p><p>“Where did they leave the country? I have seen clips on social media where he said some things they promised to do, particularly on power; some people collected some trillions and didn’t deliver… Former Vice-President is part of the rot this country became.</p><p>“He cannot exculpate himself; he cannot sit in judgment over anybody. He played his part for eight years and they left the country where they left it. He cannot like Pontius Pilate, begin to wash himself clean of what Nigeria has become.” Adesina said on Sunday when he appeared as a guest on Channels TV.</p><p>His reaction comes as a response to an earlier statement on Sunday by former Vice President Atiku titled; ‘World’s Highest Unemployment Rate: Time To Help This Government Help Nigeria’ which he made available to <strong>Naija News</strong>.</p><p>Atiku declared that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>it is time for those who truly believe in the country</a></strong> to help the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p>He noted that it has become obvious that the current administration lacks the capacity to help the nation and the citizens but anyone who has the interest of Nigerians at heart must rise up and help in whichever way they can.</p><p>He added that the Buhari administration has a habit of rejecting ideas from other quarters but the indices continue to show Nigeria is not heading in the right direction under the current administration, hence the need for stakeholders to continue talking.</p><p>The former Vice President lamented that all the gains accrued to the nation by previous democratic leaders particularly during the administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo have been eroded due to wrong government policies.</p><p>In another news, the Presidency has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>debunked trending reports</a></strong> that President Muhammadu Buhari during his campaigns in 2015, promised to make one naira equivalent to one US dollar.</p><p>According to the president’s special adviser on media and publicity, <strong>Femi Adesina</strong>, reports that Buhari promised Nigerians to make one naira equal to one dollar is totally false.</p><p>Adesina made the rebuttal on Sunday when he featured as a guest on Channels TV Sunday politics.</p><p>“It does not exist, it is fake, it is false, it is apocryphal, it doesn’t,” he declared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FyZqmqlai2pbHNnLBmqpWluaqx0maYraGbqnqistOeqWaglWLAorXDZpmuoJGntm64wJyirGWTlr2ir8itsGasn2K%2FtrjEZqWin5WntqJ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dominique-sachse-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dominique Sachse - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mikel-arteta-says-a-lot-can-still-happen-for-arsenal-in-transfer-market.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mikel Arteta Says &amp;quot;A Lot&amp;quot; Can Still Happen For Arsenal In Transfer Market</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
