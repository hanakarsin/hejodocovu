They went on to formally publish their congratulations to him as the elected candidate of the party.</p><p>“The development, in which aspirants congratulate the elected candidate, is novel in Anambra party politics. It attests to the acceptability of the candidacy of Valentine Ozigbo and the transparency of the process from which he emerged.</p><p>“We acknowledge that Mr Ozigbo is still reaching out in dialogue to few aspirants who feel aggrieved. At the end of the process, the PDP will emerge as one family under one big umbrella that accommodates everyone.</p><p>“We confirm that the PDP has forwarded only the name of Mr Valentine Ozigbo as its candidate for the 2021 Governorship Election to INEC. We also confirm that he had submitted his credentials to INEC and that all the procedural necessities that should follow before INEC’s publication of the list of candidates had been completed.</p><p>“Mr Valentine Ozigbo appreciates the interests of his teeming supporters and Ndi Anambra as a whole over the current situation. He calls on them to keep faith with the process as all is under control.”</p><p>“The issues will be resolved in no time and open the space for a one-of-a-kind campaign on issues that were top on the minds of Ndi Anambra with regards to their yearnings for transformational leadership that will usher in a new era of peace and progress to the<br>State.”</p><p>Meanwhile, some Northern lawmakers have <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>stated the reason</a></strong> why the region deserves to retain the presidency in 2023.</p><p>Recall that the Southern Governors Forum had demanded that the presidency shifts to the South in the spirit of fairness, equity, and justice.</p><p>Addressing a press conference on Friday, Speaker of the Kogi State House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, said that the south had ruled for 14 years while the north would have ruled for 10 years at the end of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BwZpqmkaKvs62Ma2draV2lsbF5wpqlnaGUlsGmedGemJyso2LBsHnEsZqlraOevK95xaumpmWZo7Kkecuiqq1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./429388-wangui-ngirici-aonekana-na-dp-ruto-saa-chache-baada-ya-madai-anataka-kuhepa-karen-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wangui Ngirici Aonekana na DP Ruto Saa Chache Baada ya Madai Anataka Kuhepa Karen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./687436-tears-anguish-lagos-demolishes-oshodi-photos-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Owonifari Market In Oshodi Reduced To Rubbles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
