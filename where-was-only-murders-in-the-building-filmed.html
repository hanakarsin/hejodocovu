The Hulu comedy takes place in NYC, and it stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>True crime and comedy don't seem like a duo that would work, but for some reason, listeners flock to podcasts like <a href=#>My Favorite Murder</a> and Morbid in droves. Hulu essentially capitalized on that fanbase, and thus <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a> was born.</p><p>The series stars frequent collaborators Steve Martin and Martin Short, and it features <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>. Their characters, Charles, Oliver, and Mabel, respectively, bond when they find out that they all listen to the podcast, All Is Not OK in Oklahoma.</p><p>The trio gets the opportunity to host a podcast of their own — and to see if their passion for true crime extends beyond their listening — when someone is murdered in their luxury Upper West Side apartment building, the Arconia.</p><p>The show largely takes place in the Manhattan neighborhood, and the interior of the apartment complex is a frequent setting as well. Where was the comedy series actually filmed? Furthermore, is there the potential for a Season 3? Keep reading to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Only Murders in the Building' filmed?</h2><p>Even the most jaded New Yorkers will feel at home while watching Only Murders in the Building, as the series features shots of some of the most notable spots in the city that never sleeps.</p><p>The Season 1 opening scene features Charles walking near the West Side of Central Park, and he even passes the notorious Dakota apartment building (which is where John Lennon was shot). He then stops to take a photo with a fan, and he realizes that he is officially a washed up actor.</p><p>The Arconia is the apartment building where the main characters live and where the murder takes place. Though it is a fictional residential building, the Belnord on the Upper West Side was used for the exterior shots of the Arconia. The Belnord was built in 1909, and it's known for its architecture, its grand courtyard, and for featuring 13 floors worth of grand apartments.</p><p>However, the interior of the building was not utilized in the show, meaning that you can't go to the Belnord and rent Charles, Mabel, or Oliver's apartments.</p><p>Those interior scenes, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic,</a> are shot on sets at the Silvercup Studios North. The studio is located in The Bronx. The Bronx was also utilized during the scene when Mabel and Oliver are kidnapped by Theo, who takes them to what is in real life the Stuyvesant Energy Corporation, located in Port Morris, N.Y.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>The next location utilized by the show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Untapped Cities</a>, is Court Square in Long Island City. This spot was selected to replicate the Supreme Court of New York State.</p><p>Fans of the show will also see Mabel and Oliver strolling along Broadway on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which can easily be identified by glimpses in the show of Westside Market, a famous grocer located in that neighborhood.</p><p>When Oliver and Charles are following Oscar and Mabel in Season 1, Episode 5, their travels take them to a gas station and convenience store in upstate New York, also per Untapped Cities. In real life, this scene was filmed in Rockaway, Queens at Waterview Car Care.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>In another episode, when Charles goes to see Jan's big concert at the New York Symphony, the scenes are shot in the city's most famous venue for that kind of music: Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center.</p><p>Heading slightly beyond the boundaries of New York City, the show also takes us to Elmsford, N.Y., where per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LoHud</a>, filming took place at Maxwell's Pub on East Main Street in the small village for Season 2 of the hit show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a 'Only Murders in the Building' Season 3?</h2><p>Given that Only Murders in the Building Season 2 recently premiered on June 28, 2022, there is no definitive information regarding the release of Season 3 just yet. However, if the show's second season pulls as many viewers as its first did, it's likely that Season 3 will come around as a part of the 2023-2024 Hulu offerings.</p><p>It's clear from all of these unique and breathtaking filming locations that the creative minds behind Only Murders in the Building are looking to remain as true to the essence of New York as possible. By utilizing these famous NYC landmarks as the backdrop for this thrilling murder mystery, The Big Apple's millions of residents have yet another binge-worthy show set in their own backyards to enjoy.</p><p>Be sure to check out Only Murders in the Building Season 2, streaming on Hulu now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXaS7rcWMpqyrnJWnwG61zWaroZ1dl8KquMOipaBllp65rrHD</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-michelle-job-90-day-fiance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>90 Day Fianc's Ashley on Being a Witch and Bodybuilding (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wike-denies-suit-seeking-atiku-tambuwals-disqualification.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wike Denies Suit Seeking Atikus Disqualification</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
