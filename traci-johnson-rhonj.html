Plus, the former lawyer shared how Tiki gets along with the RHONJ husbands.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jackie Goldschneider said 'RHONJ' addition Traci Johnson has a "fiery personality."</h2><p>Though some housewives are notorious for giving the newbies a tough time, or for failing to embrace any fresh blood on their respective programs, Jackie immediately clicked with Traci when she joined RHONJ as a friend.</p><p>Since Jackie has been close friends with Melissa during her own tenure on the Bravo series, it only makes sense that she would get along with the Envy owner's other pal, too.</p><p>"I loved Traci right from the start. I am so happy to say that, now, she's truly one of my closest friends. I love her. I think she was a great addition, and I'm excited for everybody to meet her," Jackie shared exclusively with Distractify.</p><p>The freelance writer got along with Traci on a personality level, but she also joked that the former model brought other things to the table on the show.</p><p>"She's so beautiful to look at — and that's part of it. I love seeing like her outfits, her hair, and her makeup," Jackie added. "She's just really beautiful, but she's also a great person and she has a fiery personality."</p><p>Impressing any of the main stars is a feat in and of itself for all new Housewives cast members, but there's another test to be passed on RHONJ in particular: can Traci's husband get along with the other guys?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The mom of four shared whether Tiki Barber gets along with the other 'RHONJ' guys.</h2><p>While Tiki is a household name thanks to his longevity as a running back for the New York Giants and for his subsequent broadcasting work on Today (which is how he met Traci), Jackie noted that he "came right in" and embraced his role on the show. She noted that he quickly became a part of the bromance that exists between all of the Jersey husbands.</p><p>"Evan and him got along so well," Jackie shared about Tiki's burgeoning friendship with her husband of more than 15 years. "He's just totally a part of the wolfpack."</p><p>Tiki may be getting along with the likes of Evan, Joe Gorga, Frank Catania, Louie Ruelas, Bill Aydin, and Joe Benigno, but the same can't necessarily be said when it comes to the dynamic among the ladies.</p><p>From Jackie's own reconciliations with Teresa and Jennifer, to Joe Gorga's disagreement with his nieces, to the rumors surrounding Teresa's now-fiancé, Louie, there's plenty going down in the Garden State this time around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>How will the drama shake out on Season 12?
