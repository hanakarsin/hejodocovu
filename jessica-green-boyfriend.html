At 19 years old, Jessica made her acting debut in the 2012 Australian fantasy teen drama Lightning Point. She played Kiki for all 26 episodes of the series, and she nabbed the role because of her martial arts skills.</p><p>The series was canceled after one season.</p><p>After Lightning Point, Jessica appeared in several Australian films, including Rise (2014) and Red Billabong (2016).</p><p>Her first acting credit in the United States was as a townsperson in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. The 2017 movie was the fifth in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She also played Lexx in one episode of the New Zealand series Ash vs. Evil Dead in 2018.</p><p>Before landing the role of Talon on The Outpost, Jessica played Cleopatra in the second season of the Netflix anthology series Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Jessica Green have a boyfriend? Is she in a relationship?</h2><p>It does not appear as if the actress is in a relationship, and she has not shared a photo online to suggest that she is. Because she leads a life in the public eye as a result of her work, there's also every chance that she is keeping some of her personal life private.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Outpost' is now in its fourth season.</h2><p>Ahead of the Oct. 8 2020 premiere for Season 3, The CW revealed that The Outpost had officially been picked up for 13 more episodes. The third season was split into two parts, and Season 4 premiered in July 2021.</p><p>Filming for Season 3 of The Outpost shut down temporarily in March of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Production resumed in June of 2020, and filming took place in Serbia.</p><p>It's unclear at this time whether these added episodes were shot at the same time as Part 1 of Season 3.&nbsp;</p><p>The Outpost airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. on The CW.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7K0v8icmGafopqyr3nBqLCfqpmau6U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./helena-vestergaard-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Helena Vestergaard - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ukraine-vs-russia-war-bayern-munichs-lewandowski-reacts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ukraine Vs Russia War: Bayern Munich's Lewandowski Reacts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
