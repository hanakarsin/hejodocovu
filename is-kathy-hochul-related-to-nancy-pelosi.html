Cuomo won't formally step down until later in August, but when he does, Hochul will become governor. Even as her name began circulating online, though, rumors swirled about who she may or may not be related to.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kathy Hochul related to Nancy Pelosi?</h2><p>One of the most prominent rumors online was that Kathy Hochul was the stepsister of current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Although the rumor was circulated fairly widely, it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">completely false</a>. Pelosi doesn't have any stepsiblings, and her only sibling period is her late brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III. Pelosi's parents were married in 1928 and remained married until her father died in 1987. She couldn't have stepsiblings, because neither of her parents ever remarried.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Hochul, meanwhile, is one of six children, and her parents remained married until her mother died in 2014. Hochul, therefore, couldn't have had any stepsiblings either.</p><p>As Snopes noted in their fact check of the rumor, this is not the first time that two political figures have been linked by a false rumor. It was falsely claimed that Rep. Adam Schiff was married to George Soros' daughter, for example.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kathy Hochul married?</h2><p>Although she may not have any stepsiblings, Hochul does have a family of her own. Her husband is William Hochul, who once served as a US district attorney for Western New York. Now, he works as a Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary to Delaware North Companies, Incorporated. The two have been married since 1984, and William will soon be the first First Gentleman of New York State.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Kathy Hochul have any children?</h2><p>In addition to a decades-long marriage, Hochul also has two children. Their names are Will and Katie, although her personal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> doesn't offer many additional details about their ages or what they're currently doing. As the children of the lieutenant governor, they likely enjoyed more anonymity than they will now that they're the children of New York's first female governor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lt.

"It is the right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a>. “As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State’s 57th Governor.”</p><p>Hochul will be up for reelection next year, and if she chooses to seek the Democratic nomination, her role as the incumbent governor will make her one of the frontrunners for the job. She served as Cuomo's lieutenant governor for the last seven years, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent reporting</a> suggested that she hadn't spoken with him since February when the harassment scandal that eventually drove him from office first broke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut8Ctn7JlmKSwqcHLZqmepJGpsqV506hkp5memMZuvMSlpqyh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mia-rodriguez-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mia Rodriguez - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./repentant-boko-haram-terrorists-to-enjoy-foreign-education-through-tetfund-ubec-senate-bill.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Repentant Boko Haram Terrorists To Enjoy Foreign Education Through TETFUND, UBEC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
