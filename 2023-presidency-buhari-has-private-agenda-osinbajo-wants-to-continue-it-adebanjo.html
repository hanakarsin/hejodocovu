Why should I not create state police?’</p><p>“Since he (referring to the president) has been in office, has he addressed the nation during May Day? When he wants to talk to us, he goes abroad. What is he doing so well?</p><p>“What is the value of the naira in 2015? What is the value now? How much were we buying petrol in 2015? How much is it now?</p><p>The Afenifere leader knocked Osinbajo for stating that he wants to become President to continue what Buhari has started, arguing that Nigeria has not fared any better under the leadership of the current administration.</p><p>“The vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, now said he wants to succeed him and continue his works and continue the insecurity and poverty.”</p><p>On April 11, 2022, Prof. Osinbajo officially declared his aspiration to succeed President Buhari by seeking the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49rZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6u1KGYq6Fdna60ec%2BroK%2BZpJp6orPEp5uaZZ%2Botq%2BuwKOmZq%2BRo8G0edOoZJynnqm2r8HEZqCtZZGZsqOtzaOmaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./again-pdp-warns-senate-against-confirming-onochie-for-inec.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Again, PDP Warns Senate Against Confirming Onochie For INEC</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-14-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>14 Year Old Actresses | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
