Details and spoilers ahead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The good new and bad news is that <a href=#>Season 5</a> of the addictive <a href=#>Netflix</a> dating show <a href=#>Too Hot to Handle</a> is officially over. Fans are dying to know which of the steamy couples — if any — made it past the finale and into real life.</p><p>The couples who had a shot at a happily ever after at the end of the season include <a href=#>Alex and Elys</a>, <a href=#>Isaac</a> and Hannah, and <a href=#>Louis and Christine</a>. Who is still an item and who called it quits after leaving Too Hot to Handle? Read on for all the juicy details.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alex and Elys</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Our hopes were high that this <a href=#>Barbie and Ken couple</a> might stay together after Season 5 ended, especially since they spoke those three little words to one another: "I love you."</p><p>The couple didn't last and are not together, mainly since their travel plans didn't align. Remember, Alex hails from London, while Elys is a Switzerland native — although for now, it seems she has taken up residency in Los Angeles.</p><p>The new reality star took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> to declare she is single, but it doesn't seem like there's any <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bad blood between her and Alex</a>. They still follow each another on Instagram.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Isaac and Hannah</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Like Elys and Alex, Hannah and Alex had geography to deal with when it came to taking their relationship off-screen, with her from Los Angeles, while Isaac calls New Jersey home.</p><p>Their other main challenge was that they both had wandering eyes while filming, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">weren't one another's only hookups</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, the relationship didn't even make it to the finale, and Isaac and Hannah are definitely not together. Even though Alex tagged himself in Hollywood in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post after the show aired, there is no indication that he met up with Hannah.</p><p>Likewise, Isaac is nowhere to be found on Hannah's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, and let's just say she doesn't seem sad about it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Louis and Christine</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>While this couple's road to love was a little rocky — Louis hooked up with someone else, which upset Christine — in the end they chose each other instead of money.</p><p>It seems as though they left Too Hot to Handle as a couple, but it's a bit unclear if they're still making things work. It has been reported that both are in the Los Angeles area at the same time, but neither has snapped photos together to share on social media.</p><p>In fact, Louis shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selfie</a> with Elys instead, although there's no indication that it was more than a friendly pic. Meanwhile, Christine has also posted photos of herself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with Elys</a>, as well as other Too Hot to Handle cast members — but not Louis.</p><p>For now, it's safe to assume that none of the couples from Season 5 are together, but to be fair, it isn't as though the steamy reality show is known for inspiring everlasting love.</p><p>Consider that since its inception, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only two couples</a> have made their relationships work long term, including <a href=#>Emily and Cam</a> from <a href=#>Season 2</a>, and <a href=#>Kayla and Seb</a> from <a href=#>Season 4</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyweceoq2asn2K1orrDpZxmq5WWwLC6jG5knKelpbmmv4ysq6KknGLBsLPErZ%2Beqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bolt-food-pg-unilever-three-other-major-foreign-companies-that-departed-nigeria-in-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bolt Food, P&amp;amp;G, Unilever, Three Other Major Foreign Companies That Departed Nigeria In 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./323259-sensa-2019-duale-apinga-matokeo-kuelekea-mahakamani-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sensa 2019: Duale apinga matokeo, kuelekea mahakamani</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
