The rapper, writer, and actress first appeared on the show in a 2015 episode titled "The Danger Zone," where she teamed up with the legendary Stevie J and his girlfriend, Mimi Faust, for the sake of starting a business venture. &nbsp;</p><p>Lil Kim's protégé has finally returned to the show for another season — and she's ready to take down the divas always at the ready to kick up a fuss.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tiffany Foxx first appeared in 'Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta' in 2015.</h2><p>Tiffany is a well-established rapper and musician with a solid following.&nbsp;</p><p>She started making music in 2005. Instead of wasting time with tinkering away on sketchily-produced EPs or trying to get to know the figureheads in the industry, she went straight for it — kicking off her career with a collaboration with Snoop Dogg.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Since then, she released several mixtapes, including "Yellowtape," "Goal Diggers," "King Foxx," and "Street Is Watching."

She appeared on several TV shows, including the cultic MTV chat show covering the latest goings-on in the world of hip hop music, RapFix Live; a talk show exploring the various aspects of LGBTQ culture, Dishing Tea with Big Meach; and a now-discontinued show introducing viewers to the very best hip hop videos, 106 & Park.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Tiffany made an appearance on the Million Dollar Matchmaker in 2017.&nbsp;According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsters and Critics</a>, she was diagnosed by friends as the "ultimate bad-boy magnet" long before she would have reached out to Million Dollar Matchmaker host Patti Stanger.
