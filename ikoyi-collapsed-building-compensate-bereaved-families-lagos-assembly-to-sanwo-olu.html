If the agencies had done the needful we would not have this sad occurrence,” he said.</p><p>Hon. Nureni Akinsanya (Mushin 1), who moved the motion, earlier expressed worry over the collapse of the building in the state.</p><p>In the motion he moved on the floor, Akinsanya said: “The House expressed worry over the wide speculation that the building was raised to 21 floors contrary to the 15 floors approved by the Lagos State Physical planning permit authority (LASPPPA) for the owner.”</p><p>The motion added that the House was worried that over time, the State had recorded series of building collapse like the one that happened at in November 2006 and a 3-storey building that collapsed in Ita Faaji in 2016, among others.</p><p>“The House is disturbed about the constant collapse of buildings in the state and the manner in which agencies set up to inspect building work, give certification at various stages of construction and keep records for ease of reference, and realise that these frequent cases of building collapse can be attributed to unqualified or unskilled builders, use of sub-standard building materials, illegal conversion or alterations to existing structures and lack of maintenance to mention a few,” the motion said.</p><p>The House then mandated its Committee on Physical Planning and Urban Development to invite the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development as well as other agencies saddled with the responsibilities of issuing approval, monitoring of construction and project development with a view to ascertaining the level of compliance with the extant laws and regulations relating to buildings in the state.</p><p>The lawmakers after discussing the motion observed a minute silence for the repose of the souls of those who lost their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49xZqKjn662bq%2FOpaOaqKOasW6u1KKjnaGenHqku8ypnKerkamybq7Eq5yarpWZeqetzKKjop2jYrmis86sZJqro5q6o7jYZquoZaOWu7i7jKijrmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-party-withdraws-petition-against-tinubu-at-presidential-election-tribunal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Party Withdraws Petition Against Tinubu At Presidential Election Tribunal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./francesca-battistelli-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Francesca Battistelli - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
