She took to Instagram live in early March to say that she doesn't plan to go to jail, in large part because she has a son to raise. Following Chrisean's Instagram live session, though, many wondered why the star was supposed to go to jail in the first place.</p><p>Chrisean is apparently supposed to turn herself in over charges that were first brought in 2022. Here's what we know about the charges against Chrisean, and why she's supposed to be going to jail.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why is Chrisean Rock going to jail?</h2><p>A bench warrant was first issued in Chrisean's case in February in Oklahoma because of alleged violations to her parole. Chrisean was originally sentenced to four years of parole in Oklahoma over drug charges.</p><p>Chrisean's probation violation stems from an incident in which she got into an altercation with James Wright at a Tamar Braxton show in November of 2023. James sued Chrisean in February, claiming that she had punched him in the face and broken two of his teeth.</p><p>“She hit him multiple times in the face for no reason at all,” James Wright's lawyer Kevin Anderson told the Los Angeles Times. “We were surprised that she was able to leave the facility that night. She had on rings that were pretty much equivalent to brass knuckles.”</p><p>The bench warrant was issued in Oklahoma even though Chrisean is now living in California.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What are the charges against Chrisean?</h2><p>When Chrisean was first arrested, she faced two charges: possession of a controlled dangerous substance without a tax stamp and possession with the intent to distribute. Specifically, she was found to be in possession of crack cocaine.</p><p>Ultimately, she managed to avoid jail time for those charges, instead receiving four years of parole, even though both of those charges can carry a one year sentence.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DaBigBabyChrisean (@chrisean)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@chrisean</span></figure><p>Now, Chrisean is refusing to turn herself in — not over these original charges, but over a bench warrant alleging that she violated her parole by getting into a fight. In her Instagram live session, Chrisean made it clear that now that she's a mother, she doesn't want to go to jail and abandon her child.</p><p>“My warrants are getting cleaned up,” she said. “I’ve been paying off fees and getting rid of s--t, talking to certain people to help my situation out ‘cause, you know, I have my son. So, the old me would have just turned myself in and dealt with it through from inside to the outside of the jail. So, whatever."</p><p>"But right now I gotta play it cautious because I don’t plan on being in jail while my son is growing," she continued. "I just don’t plan on that at all. So, I’m doing every way possible to get that figured out without even trying to serve time. And it’s working out for me. So, I’ma work on my little situations and stuff.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJygop7Apq3NZqmom5titLC1zaBkraddn66quA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./braco-gajic-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Braco Gajic - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1295949-tirkashi-mujiya-ta-kai-wa-gwamna-samuel-ortom-na-jihar-benue-hari-a-coci-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tirkashi: Mujiya ta kai wa Gwamna Samuel Ortom na jihar Benue hari a coci</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
