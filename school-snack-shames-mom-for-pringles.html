On <a href=#>TikTok</a>, a mother shared her astonishing experience with her 3-year-old son’s school after she packed him a mini container of Pringles as a snack.</p><p>The snack-shaming saga involves a passive-aggressive message, a heated confrontation, and a shocking outcome. Curious to know what went down? Let’s get into it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@peaveymegan</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A school “snack-shamed” a mom for sending her child to school with Pringles.</h2><p>On TikTok, Megan Peavey (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@peaveymegan</a> on the app) shared an unbelievable story about what her son’s school did when she packed him a small box of Pringles as a snack. “I sent my son to school with Pringles, which is a very age-appropriate snack for a 3-year-old,” the TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>.</p><p>However, her child’s educators didn’t seem to think so.</p><p>Megan then posted a photo of the empty Pringles container, displaying a snide comment in black marker.</p><p>“Please help us make healthy choices at school,” the message read. “They snack-shamed my 3-year-old [and] they snack-shamed me by writing that passive-aggressively on his trash,” the mother exclaimed.</p><p>She explained that she doesn’t label food as “healthy” and “unhealthy” in her home because that practice often leads to disordered eating. And naturally, the comment section had some thoughts.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok users offered advice on how to navigate the situation.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@peaveymegan href=#>@peaveymegan</a><p><a title=repost href=#>#repost</a> <a title=momsoftiktok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Megan PV" href=#>♬ original sound - Megan PV</a></figure><p>After revealing that she had already contacted the school and accused them of snack-shaming, Megan asked the comment section for thoughts on what they would do if they were in her shoes.</p><p>“Send Pringles the next day [and write], ‘When you buy it, you can decide what the snack is,’” one person said. Another creator added, “I’d tell them they maybe need to provide the snacks if they know what he needs.”</p><p>Jokingly, someone else wrote, “On his birthday, send Pringles to EVERY kid in the class.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The mother provided shocking updates about the snack-shaming debacle.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@peaveymegan href=#>@peaveymegan</a><p>Part one of pringle gate update <a title=update href=#>#update</a> <a title=momsoftiktok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Megan PV" href=#>♬ original sound - Megan PV</a></figure><p>The following snack-shaming events were even more problematic.</p><p>In Megan’s follow-up videos, she explained that when she spoke with the school’s director in person, they said that she was the passive-aggressive one for packing Pringles in the first place. Additionally, the director offered no apology and refused to take responsibility for the school’s actions.</p><p>And that wasn’t the worst part.</p><p>After their conversation, the director informed the TikTok creator that her son’s spot in the school’s part-time summer program had been revoked. Devastated, Megan explained that her son no longer attends that school. However, she still needs to pay for the last two weeks.</p><p>As a working mother, Megan said that packing Pringles in her son’s lunch was a matter of convenience and couldn’t believe how the events transpired.</p><p>She also reiterated that she doesn’t want to instill a “good vs. bad” mentality surrounding food, to which one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>, “This is exactly why I teach my kids there are no bad foods. Sometimes all a family can afford is Pringles. Financially or mentally.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLCpu86lZKymkZi4br%2FHmqSeq12ivK55xaipZqiinruouMSs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alicia-keys-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alicia Keys - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./william-lahoumh-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wubzzy - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
