As I said, the report itself, done by the state government, but then once it’s out, for there to actually be action on the basis of the report, action as necessary by the states, action by the Federal Government, and action in the sense of two things,” he said.</p><p>“First, making sure that based on what is documented to have happened, it won’t happen again – so there may be reforms that are necessary – and building or rebuilding trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the Federal Government.</p><p>“Second is accountability. If there are individuals that – as it emerges from this report – who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.”</p><p>On what the US would do if human rights abuses continued, he responded, “And, of course, we also have laws in place – the Leahy laws, for example – that make sure that if there are units that have committed abuses, we’re not going to provide equipment to those units.”</p><p>Asked if the US would impose the Leahy law on Nigeria, Blinken said, “Well, we look in any instance if – and if there are credible allegations that prove, that we believe meet the standard of the law, yes, of course, we’ll apply the law.”</p><p>Speaking further, he stated that Nigeria’s response would determine if the US government would bow to pressure by the US Congress to impose an arms embargo on the West African country.</p><p>Blinken said, “But the assistance itself is not just the hardware that we might provide – airplanes or helicopters – it’s the software, the human software. Because one of the things that we’re doing is making sure that as we’re providing equipment to deal with profound security challenges that are faced here in Nigeria – terrorism, criminal activity, other violence – that those who will be using the equipment are trained in a way that makes sure that they are doing it to avoid hurting the good guys even as they’re going after the bad guys, to make sure that the laws of armed conflict are fully in mind. And that if they make mistakes, they’re corrected and they’re brought to light immediately. All of that’s very important. And, of course, we also have laws in place – the Leahy laws, for example – that make sure that if there are units that are – that have committed abuses, we’re not going to provide equipment to those units.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FqZp6mlKius7%2BMrqpmrJinsqLAxKeqZqyfYrWiuNNmpKKkmamus8WMmqCdZaSkeq%2B1xp6popldpMOmvoyhrKaZnmK%2FqrPHrapmmZKqwKa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-delvey-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Delvey Was Looking for a Boyfriend in February 2021 Did She Find One?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./disney-movie-scenes-edited.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>These Disney Movie Scenes Were Edited Since They First Premiered</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
