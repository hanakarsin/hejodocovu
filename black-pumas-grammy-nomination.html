But unless you're completely in-tune with the music industry, you're probably a little perplexed (re: the Best New Artist category). Several of the names listed are totally unfamiliar, especially Black Pumas.</p><p>And if you happen to be one of many who felt <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Pumas' Grammy nomination</a> seemed out of the blue, you aren't alone: they were nominated alongside better known "new" artists, such as: Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, Lizzo, Maggie Rogers, Rosalía. Tank and the Bangas, and Yola. So, who are they? What kind of music do they make?&nbsp;</p><p>Here is everything you need to know about the Best New Artist nominee.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What kind of music do the Grammy-nominated Black Pumas make?</h2><p>LA Times describes Black Pumas as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a "soul-funk duo."</a> They hail from music capital of the country, Austin, Tex,, combining guitar from Adrian Quesada and vocals from Eric Burdon.&nbsp;</p><p>Word on the street is that they came together after Adrian was on the hunt for a singer back in 2017. Eventually, he found Eric through a friend, and now, the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p>The two musicians dropped their first-ever album on June 21, and received all-around positive reviews from popular publications like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pitchfork</u></a><u>,</u> who described their album as "dreamy," while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Atwood Magazine</a> compared their album to "opening your favorite box of chocolates on cheat day."</p><p>So bottom line: their first album was clearly well-received. And now they're in the running for a Grammy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>We're incredibly humbled and honored to be nominated for a GRAMMY for Best New Artist!

The duo actually signed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ATO Records</a> which happens to be Dave Matthews' recording company.</p><p>ATO has also signed major groups like Alabama Shakes, My Morning Jacket, and Riff Raff.&nbsp;</p><p>Their first day in the recording studio, according to ATO, Black Pumas recorded their first two singles, which are titled "Black Moon Rising" and "Fire."</p><p>And since they released those first two tracks, the dynamic duo has gone on to release a full studio album, titled "Black Pumas." Honestly, it seems as though they're doing pretty well for themselves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What are some of their most popular songs?</h2><p>On Spotify, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the band's top tracks</a> include the following titles: "Colors," "Black Moon Rising," "Fire," "OCT 33," and "Know You Better."</p><p>Also, according to their Spotify page, Black Pumas have a total of 379,629 listeners per month. Not bad!</p><p>If you aren't entirely sure where to start, I strongly suggest listening to Black Pumas' song, "Black Moon Rising." According to ATO, it was featured on NPR Music's Heavy Rotation, which they refer to as "psychedelic, funky, bold, cinematic," and, most importantly, "soulful and sincere."</p><p>And really, soulful it is, indeed. The vocals are somewhat reminiscent of Gnarls Barkley or The Foundations, combined with chill, funky background music.
