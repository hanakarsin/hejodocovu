The records are still there. And how many votes did Igbo presidential aspirants garner at the primaries? They even followed Wike to Awka to mock Peter Obi that he cannot win the primaries, and owned up to it.</p><p>Chibuike insisted that there was no Igbo presidential aspirant who could have won the primaries and successfully challenge the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>He alleged that Wike masterminded the weakness of the South East to challenge for the ticket.</p><p>“In 2011 and 2015, we made this same mistake with Goodluck Jonathan and sold our rights to the Otuoke man by adopting him as Igbo-born, bestowing upon him the name Ebele Azikiwe, and threatening that he represents Igbo interests and that any attack on him will be a direct attack on the Igbo Nation. It’s unfortunate that we have yet to learn anything from that cowardice</p><p>“If the few Igbo insist it was their turn to produce the president in PDP, we must remind them that in 2011 and 2015, we supported Jonathan as an Igbo son, and he won one term and lost the other on behalf of Ndi-Igbo. We robbed ourselves of our future and must take the blame”, he said</p><p>The deputy director lamented that he feels repulsed when he sees Igbos supporting Wike adding that such people should not identify themselves as ndi-Igbo.</p><p>He opined that if Wike was truly fighting for justice he would have supported an aspirant from the South East to clinch the PDP presidential ticket.</p><p>“The only interest of the Igbo in Nigeria today should be the alliance that will give us power. If the North will give us that alliance, we’ll be willing to make any sacrifice to gain the alliance and produce a President,” he concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BtZq2glWK2qK7OrGSlnZaperW0xGanq52jnrGmutOimKVlpJ6wrLHTZpinnF2bvK24zrCcnWWnnrimedOoZJqvm5Z6tbuMpqaco12lsrWx0Wamm6FdlsGqt9RmmpqloJa2qLqMnKauppOeuW65xKaZnqpf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./295671-think-like-a-man-cast-names-characters-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Think Like a Man cast names and characters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tribute-sister-of-fan-who-died-at-asakes-concert-drags-singer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sister Of Fan Who Died At Asake's Concert Drags Singer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
