This means that you're paying a lot more but are getting a lot less, i.e. you're getting royally screwed for the most part, every time that you fly.</p><p>And while it can be frustrating to give companies your business when you know that you're paying a lot for a less-than-stellar flying experience if you've got to get somewhere that's really far away, you're not really left with many options aside from hopping in an airplane.</p><p>This means that you're going to have to be smushed up against other people while traveling in a tin can in the sky and you can only hope that you're going to be seated next to individuals who were raised well enough to have basic etiquette and manners.</p><p>And unfortunately for TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@thewandertog</a>, she wasn't.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thewandertog href=#>@thewandertog</a><p>Tell me YOUR weirdest flight story ðŸ¥² <a title=feet href=#>#feet</a> <a title=americanairlines href=#>#americanairlines</a></p><a title="â™¬ Elevator Music - Bohoman" href=#>â™¬ Elevator Music - Bohoman</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @thewandertog</span></figure><p>While aboard an American Airlines flight, a woman who was seated behind the TikTok user thought it would be a good idea to rest her bare feet on her arm rest.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thewandertog</span></figure><p>@thewandertog writes in a text overlay of the post: "this lady's feet were on my armrest, occasionally poking me..."

The clip then transitions to the offending feet in question.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thewandertog</span></figure><p>Not only was this uncomfortable, nobody wants to get their arm poked while aboard a flight, but it's also kind of gross.

If not, how would you feel about somebody doing this? Would you do a discrete little cube, or dump a cup of ice on them so they'd get the message loud and clear?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mp66so2KzprHTZqanZaChrq%2BxjKmYrKuVo7SmvtJmmKulXaeytMA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tinubu-shettima-apc-chieftain-dumps-party-over-muslim-muslim-ticket.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>APC Chieftain Dumps Party Over Muslim-Muslim Ticket</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./45291-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Satellite Technology Fetches Nigeria N116bn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
