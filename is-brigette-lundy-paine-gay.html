Keep reading for everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Greg Gayne/Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>*Warning: This story contains some spoilers for Season 3 of </strong><strong>Atypical</strong><strong>.*</strong></p><p>Ever since <a href=#>Atypical</a> returned for Season 3, fans have been clamoring for Casey (Brigette Lundy Paine) and Izzie (Fivel Stewart) to get together.</p><p>Casey might be fans' favorite character in the show. Although she has a seemingly perfect relationship with the high school's jock, viewers have been taken by the intense friendship and will-they-won't-they relationship building up with Izzie.</p><p>After the two initially met on the track team, Season 2 ended with Izzie and Casey holding hands in the car. Thankfully, Season 3 is picking up where their potential romance left off, but the storyline has many wondering whether <a href=#>Brigette Lundy Paine is gay,</a> or if she is as confused as the character she plays.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Patrick Wymore/Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Casey gay on Atypical?</h2><p>On Atypical, we've finally seen Casey kiss Izzie after struggling to figure out whether she should suppress her feelings for Izzie or try to hang out more with her boyfriend in the hopes that her crush will go away.</p><p>Izzie is rather taken aback in Season 3, saying that she never would have opened up about how she felt if she knew that Casey would act so weird in turn. But this all changes when Casey silences Izzie with a really long kiss.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jordin Althaus/Netflix</span></figure><p>However, that also sets off Casey's guilt as she eventually confesses to Evan that she kissed someone else. When he tells her to figure out who she wants to be with, Casey tries to start an actual relationship with Izzie.</p><p>But that doesn't change a few facts about Izzie that annoy Casey, namely the fact that she doesn't like PDA and doesn't want to make the relationship public. While we're left wondering whether Casey will go back to Evan, the former couple eventually have a really mature heart to heart in the season's final episode.</p><p>The episode ends with Casey explaining to Izzie that she accepted an offer to run track for UCLA, which means that she will have to give everything up in her high school life... But she makes a point to say that she will not give Izzie up over the next two years.</p><p>When the two embrace, it's clear that Casey is still figuring out her sexuality, and isn't yet ready to put a label on whether she's a lesbian quite yet.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Brigette Lundy Paine gay?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>skrrrt</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Brigette Lundy-Paine</a> (@briiiiiiiiiig) on Apr 1, 2019 at 8:38am PDT</p></figure><p>While Casey seems to still have some work to do on herself before she settles on a sexual identity, the actress who plays her came out in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Advocate</a> last year.</p><p>"I come from a very queer family," the 25-year-old told the outlet, saying that her coming-out story was "just like a teary phone call to my mom when I had my first girlfriend." "And then after that it was kinda like, 'Oh, I don't have to really tell anybody else. I just date who I want and not have to put up with it,'" the actress went on to say.</p><p>"It's all about testing the waters," she added later, saying she has "yet to figure out if [she] ever will date a straight guy again."</p><p>Follow<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Brigette on Instagram</a> to stay up to date with her upcoming projects and dating life.&nbsp;</p><p>Season 3 of Atypical is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurtGinp6spJp6rcHNnbBmqJGeu6Z5xpqw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rick-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Ricks | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
