Let's get to know Aaron beyond the game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Aaron Donald</p></figure><p>In <a href=#>Secret Celebrity Renovation</a>, famous people return to their hometowns and the people who helped mold them in order to pay their success forward. Each episode, one celebrity gives a significant person in their life an incredible home renovation. Shows like this prove over and over again that you never know when you might be making a huge difference in a person's life. (They could also be teaching us to be nice to everyone because it could mean a brand-new kitchen someday).</p><p>In Season 2, Aaron Donald — <a href=#>defensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams</a> — is going back to Pittsburgh, Pa. to fix up his family's old house. While no one currently lives there, they still own it and use it as the communal meetup spot, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trib Live</a>. Joining Aaron in this endeavor are his wife and kids, who will hopefully someday use Aaron's childhood home as their own "hangout house." Let's get to know Aaron Donald's family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Aaron Donald and his wife Erica Donald</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aaron Donald has three kids.</h2><p>In a March 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a>, Aaron was talking about his future in the <a href=#>NFL</a>. The 31-year-old is at the top of his game, but he's been dancing around the idea of retirement for quite some time. His reasons for wanting to walk away from the game he loves don't fall under the usual umbrellas of health or financial. If Aaron left the NFL, it would be for <a href=#>his children</a>.</p><p>"People who know me understand why," he told the outlet.</p><p>Aaron has two older children, Jaeda (8) and Aaron Jr. (6), with a previous partner. They live in Pittsburgh most of the year. Aaron, his wife Erica, and their son Aaric live in Southern California. The distance between Aaron and his older two kids was starting to wear on him. In fact, he shared with Sports Illustrated the exact moment he knew things weren't working.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@aarondonald99</a><p>Aaron Donald with his family</p></figure><p>When Jaeda started first grade in 2018, Aaron couldn't be there to walk her into class for the first time. The separation was very nearly killing him and only got worse as he only saw his children a few times a month. Missing holidays, birthdays, and other milestones would bring Aaron to his knees and to tears more often than he could count. Aaron is a wonderful father, but he just won't let himself admit it. Maybe that's part of the reason why fixing up his childhood home in the city where two of his children live is so important.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aaron Donald leans on his wife, Erica, for support.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, "Aaron Donald signed a six-year, $135 million extension with the Rams in 2018," which at the time was the "richest deal ever signed by a defensive player." He has sponsorship deals with Dick's Sporting Goods, Electronic Arts, and Panini that bring in $500,000 annually. All told, he probably makes about $36 million a year. Despite all that, it's not <a href=#>money</a> that keeps Aaron grounded. It's his wife, Erica Donald.</p><p>"If it wasn’t for [Erica],” he says, “I don’t know where I would be mentally," he told Sports Illustrated.</p><p>Erica and Aaron met via work, back in 2015, when the Rams were still in St. Louis. At the time, Erica was "in community affairs and player involvement," via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a>. Aaron joined the team the previous year. Erica runs a tight ship, managing all of Aaron's marketing strategy at <a href=#>Kanye West's</a> Dondo Sports, where she's an executive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ericadonald99</a><p>Erica Donald and Aaron Donald</p></figure><p>Aaron fell so fast for Erica that he proposed to her after only four months of dating, but the couple doesn't count that one. Evidently Aaron did not have a ring, a mistake he rectified on Erica's birthday when he proposed again. Soon the couple was pregnant with their only child, Aaric, who was born in September 2021.</p><p>The couple is super adorable on Instagram, often shouting each other's accomplishments out. When <a href=#>The Rams</a> won the Super Bowl in 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erica posted</a>, "I just had to take some time to tell you how proud I am." She went on to say, "You are a true testament to the fact that hard work pays off. You couldn’t write this story any better. I love you forever! We got your back always."</p><p>Aaron Donald's episode of Secret Celebrity Renovation airs on Friday, Sept. 16 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflq6zu81mm6imkaGxbrfInao%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-last-of-us-ellie-dad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>We Meet Ellie's Mother in 'The Last of Us,' but What About Her Dad?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1334011-meet-stunning-ghanaian-nurse-black-skin-by-vitiligo-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet stunning Ghanaian nurse whose black skin has been taken over by vitiligo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
