Why else are there so many true crime podcasts about human beings engaging in abysmal acts against members of their own species? Or scripted dramas that glorify the heinous acts of societal rejects? <a href=#>You</a>, which falls into the latter category, has become one of Netflix's most-watched intellectual properties.</p><p>You originally aired on Lifetime. After Netflix bought the rights to stream the show, it quickly greenlit a second season after viewers began binge-watching it en masse. But how did Season 2 end?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How did season 2 of 'You' end?</h2><p>If you're unfamiliar with the basis of You, Penn Badgley of Gossip Girl and that super underrated part in Margin Call fame plays a total loser by the name of Joe who has an obsession with stalking people and even goes so far as to kill them. Since the show was about a good-looking dude who likes to harm women, it definitely seemed like the perfect fit for Lifetime.</p><p>While one would think that the network that produced Baby for Sale would probably greenlight several seasons of a show like You, the series was ultimately canceled and found new life on Netflix.</p><p>Season 2 was a smash success and just like the show's first batch of episodes, fans who watched it had varying opinions on its direction and the eventual fates of its major characters.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The ending of Season 2 revealed that Joe's love interest (named Love) is a killer like himself. After Joe learns she murdered his neighbor Delilah along with Candace, his ex-girlfriend, he isn't exactly happy. He was probably thinking, "What's good for the goose isn't exactly what's good for the gander" or whatever weird psycho-nerd stuff he scribbles in old Hustler magazines when no one's looking.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i just finished season 2 of you and joe nor love deserved the ending they got. forty deserved better. ellie deserved better. delilah deserved SO much better. i’m irate. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PnuoPbKZBV</a></p>— mac (@lolcornell) <a href=#>December 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Joe almost kills Love after learning that she's a murderer like him (hypocritical, much?), but then she tells him that she's pregnant with his child. "Nothing is more important than this," he says after letting go of her throat. Our poisoned race must persist regardless, right?</p><p>But everything isn't smooth sailing after that. Love's brother — who has an equally ridiculous name, Forty — decides he's gonna end Joe once and for all.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Season 2 of YOU was incredible. The plot twists, storytelling & even cinematography was amazing. The characters were way better written & more likeable than season 1. I felt like I really knew love, Ellie, forty, & Delilah. The amount of twists & turns had me hooked right in.</p>— antphrodite [Psychic] (@antphrodite) <a href=#>December 28, 2019</a></figure><p>He brings a gun to a Joe-fight and points the firearm at Mr. Badgley until police officer Fincher comes in and lights him up like being named after malt liquor containers is a crime.</p><p>In order to clean up the nasty mess of Forty's death, Fincher then pins Henderson's death on Love's screw-up of a brother.</p><p>Although Henderson is a local celebrity, no one is really mourning his death because he's a dude who preys on underage girls (who just so happens to be played by an actor who was accused of ... preying on underage girls).</p><p>After all of this goes down, Joe and Love end up living a quiet-seeming life in suburban Los Angeles. He's chilling in the backyard, reading a book, when someone catches his eye.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>watching You season 2 and realizing “Forty” and “Love” are tennis terms and they’re twins who play tennis together <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UCfWXRv9jp</a></p>— Alye Freeman (@alyefree) <a href=#>January 2, 2020</a></figure><p>That someone is his next-door neighbor, who obviously becomes the latest object of his obsessive nature. Joe narrates as he creepily peers at the mystery woman: "This is just the beginning because this is where I had to be. Exactly where I had to be to meet you. There you were with your books and your sunshine. So close but worlds away. I will figure out a way, a way to get to you. See you soon, neighbor."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When does Season 3 of 'You' debut?</h2><p>If you want to see where the showrunners take Joe and Love's parental adventures, you'll have to wait until October 15th to do so, when all episodes of You's third season are released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2axn6p6tLHArKanZWJisq%2Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jim-root-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Root - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./docm77-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Docm77 - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
