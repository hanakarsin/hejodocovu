Many consider him an extremely lucky man who has all that he has as a result of the grace of God.</p><p class=align-left>The following points give the major highlights about the former Nigerian president:</p><p class=h3>1. He came into limelight in 1969-1970</p><p class=align-left>Obasanjo, fondly called OBJ by many, came into limelight in 1969-1970 when he became then new commander of the Third Marine Commando. Although the Nigerian civil war had technically ended before his appointment, Benjamin Adekunle did majority of the work yet, the glory was given to Obasanjo.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 6 SAFETY TIPS you must adhere to if you do not want an Okada to fall you down</p><p class=h3>2. His political ascension</p><p class=align-left>The former Nigerian president was also favoured during the regime of General Gowon; afterwards, he became the vice president to Late Alhaji Murtala Mohammed. As a person protected by grace, the coup planned against Mohammed was a huge success as Dimka finished the then head of state.</p><p class=align-left>The work was again completed by Dimka but the glory was given to Obasanjo, the man who knew nothing about the plot. The assassination plot was planned in three ways, Obasanjo and T.Y Danjuma were meant to be attacked too as stated by the Murtala Mohammed’s orderly who was in the car with him when he killed.</p><p class=h3>3. Not his will, according to his book</p><p class=align-left>Dimka, despite killing Mohammed, did not get to power; Obasanjo did. The book written by Obasanjo ‘Not my will’ tells a lot about his journey as a Nigerian politician.</p><p class=align-left>His life and journey will continue to be a source of inspiration to many politicians.</p><p class=h3>4. He was the first military man to hand over to civilian government without any struggle</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6jr1ngqeatg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Also, he became the first military man in Nigeria to hand over power to civilian government without any tussle as seen with ex-president Jammeh of the Gambia.</p><p class=align-left>He was considered to be the most important African in the international community before the Mandela era. His attributes and charisma as a born leader puts him at the forefront of Nigeria’s well-loved leaders</p><p class=align-left>Obasanjo is also considered to be the first retired military man to rule Nigeria under democracy. He ruled for eight years and attempted a third term but failed. Before this time, he became a critic of Shagari, the man he handed over power to.</p><p class=h3>5. His life as a critic</p><p class=align-left>He openly criticized IBB who likes and respects him. Abacha did not like him the same way; thus, he got him arrested and sentenced him through Major General Aziza. Aziza is late now, yet Obasanjo is alive, hale and hearty.</p><p class=align-left>Thousands of Nigerians hold the belief that the death of M.K.O Abiola paved way for OBJ; this put him the position of leadership just as the death of Murtala launched him forward.</p><p class=align-left>Irrespective of all these, the Ogun state born leader will always remain an important personality in the history of Nigeria.</p><p class=h3>6. On setting Nigeria on fire</p><p class=align-left>It will be unfair to sing the praises of Obasanjo without mentioning the role he played when many said he allegedly set Nigeria on fire.</p><p class=align-left>He handed over power to Yar’adua who died while in power. Former president Goodluck Jonathan took over. That perhaps, was the beginning of the end of PDP.</p><p class=h3>7. Major projects</p><p class=align-left>The major projects done by Olusegun Obasanjo moved Nigeria forward with more than a thousand steps at a time.</p><p class=align-left>Operation feed the nation was orchestrated in his regime; he built refineries; saved a lot of money in the treasury; he established the EFCC, ICPC, pension reforms and others. He also completed Festac and instituted all the gas power plant in the country today.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> On Xenophobia: Not all Nigerians are criminals, another Nigerian in S/Africa reiterates</p><p class=h3>8. A friend to no one</p><p class=align-left>The saying ‘I am for everybody and belong to nobody’ clearly describes Obasanjo’s lifestyle. He has no friends; he is not a friend to anybody. While this is true, people dread having him against them as he wields so much power and authority.</p><p class=align-left>Chief Olusegun Obasanjo clocked 80 today, March 5, and is as strong as ever. Again, the grace of God has kept him till this very day. A very happy birthday to the iconic Nigerian leader.</p><p class=align-left>Watch the video of Obasanjo dancing at his 79th birthday party:</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnGFkHJpb2VoYrqits6rZKmnmaPBtHnSrqSmmaKex6Z5zpuYrJmen7y0edGeoKCmXZZ6r7XGnqmimZ5iuaatw56pZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-toyin-abraham-rocks-long-dreadlocks-on-42nd-birthday-kolawole-ajeyemi-eulogizes-her.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actress Toyin Abraham Rocks Long Dreadlocks On 42nd Birthday, Kolawole Ajeyemi Eulogizes Her</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anny-and-robert-baby-died-90-day-fiance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to '90 Day Fianc' Stars Anny and Robert's Baby?
