How long will it take to complete a Lagos-Ibadan expressway that is about 200 km?”</p><h2>It’s The World’s Longest Project</h2><p>The lawyer lamented that the Lagos-Ibadan expressway has become the world’s longest project and called on the federal government as well as the contractors handling the project to speed up the rate of work.</p><p>He said: “I’ve been on that road and nearly lost my life. You see people sandwiched between trucks and inhaling fumes. I know people who have died and have various degrees of health challenges from using that road.”</p><p>“This is the longest project anyone has embarked on in the world. Being probably the busiest road in Sub-Saharan Africa, it shouldn’t take up to the time it has taken now. Anyone who has suffered a health challenge should take the FG to court because they are liable.”</p><p>The lawyer however commended the government for delivering on some other infrastructures and projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49xZpqok2K0sMLTZpuepJGutq%2BzjKmpqKKVmMG0edOoZKCdpGLDsMDErGSipl1nfXN%2FjJqbnp%2BSpL%2B2w8Bmoqenk6DAbrLGaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./finneas-o-connell-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Finneas O'Connell - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./deborah-samuel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Deborah Samuel On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
