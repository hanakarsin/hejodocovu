Cool new profile pic, dad.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I'm not even sure where this guy got the filter, but the more I look at it, the more inspired it seems. I want to try!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">2. Jane hasn't quite figured out speech-to-text.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>And it's terrifying! Poor thing, but I really can't stop laughing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">3. Thanks for the great review, Peter.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Is that weird spacing a setting? It looks like the Xanga and Myspace days of yore.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">4. DON'T SCHOOL ME ON CAPS LOCKS. JEEZ.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>She started data entry back in 1958 on IBM machines, so she knows what a keyboard looks like. Sheesh. To be fair, she does make some valid points.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">5. So many things going on at once here!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Trying out a new platform, a dad joke, a concerned online friend, and finally a response from the poster. Glad all is well there!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">6. Beautiful sentiment with the wrong emoji.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I've seen parents misuse the crying-laughing emoji so many times but I never have the heart to say anything! Imagine having to correct this grieving soul?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">7. TMI GRANDMA!!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Jeez, grandma. I never knew you and gramps stayed so passionate so long. Hell, that's more action than a lot of 20-year-olds get.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">8. Who sang â€”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>This reminds me of the time Cher tweeted asking if anyone could "c" her. This Jimmy Buffett fan probably forgot that Google was just a quick click away.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">9. Lovely profile pic, pops.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Seems someone missed the mark on this crop, or is very proud of their (and grandma's!) forehead. I love the cute fairy dog too. Where do baby boomers get all these cute widgets and filters?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">10. Canoe for sale... not.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Came to the Facebook Marketplace, obviously not to sell a $75 canoe, but just to warn you about it. "Terrible service from both... Terrible!!!! No Lie." After all that trouble just to share your honest review, I believe you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">11. Confused the comment box with the Google search box. Whoops!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>"How do I get rid of a clingy ex" followed by "GARLIC BREAD RECIPE"... Are exes still clingy when they reach old age? Who is this person?! I kind of want to be their friend.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">12. Excuse me, what?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>These accidental Google searches have to be my favorite brand of baby-boomer online humor. But I just wish this person had been given the time to finish their question! What exactly did wood doors have to do with World War II? I never paid much attention in history class and I'm honestly dying to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">13. Nice hacking job, dad.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>This dad should join the FBI. He clearly is a master at covering his traces!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">14. Dan can't take the timeline anymore.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Poor Dan never realized that signing up for Facebook would just mean being forced to read everything you didn't care to know about everyone you friended. But now everyone he's friends with will see these cries for help, and I really want a follow-up screenshot to see what happened to Dan and his social media presence.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">15. Nice try, Deb.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Super clever move, Deb! Millennials do have a lot to learn from your generation, it's true. Next time I want to go for dinner, I'll give the restaurant 5 stars on Yelp with a comment that reads, "Will you make a special dine-in price just for me?"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">16. I'm not a cop.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Maybe this is their generation's version of "asking for a friend"? Either that, or Hector is one THOUSAND percent definitely totally a cop.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">17. Couch for sale.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>That feel when you want to sell a cute, comfortable, three-seater couch and accidentally end up posting a picture of your dog. No, but really don't feel bad, it happens to me all the time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">18. Carolyn won't stand for plagiarism.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>She doesn't want you to think she traveled into space with an expensive telescopic lens just because she posted this picture.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">19. Where is this conversation taking place?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Honest to God, this made me laugh out loud because I've had the exact same text message conversation with both of my parents.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">20. The most wholesome wholesome-meme.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>"Keep up the good work, friend!" I wish everyone took the time and mental effort to constructively critique the digital multimedia work millennials spend hours of their time making and sharing.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">21. Oh, boy.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>This lady just diagnosed herself with OCD and I can't tell if she's hilarious and sarcastic or totally earnest and adorable. "What this means for me, I'm not sure. Will have to wait and see." If that test is the only barometer, I have OCD too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">22. She had enough of seeing chihuahua pics in the chihuahua Facebook group.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I wonder if she just thought all of Facebook was obsessed with no other breed than chihuahuas. Maybe she's a German Shepherd person. Who knows.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">23. HIV positive or negative.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I believe this person was in their early 30s... Thirty years ago, maybe! But at least this Christian is somewhat open-minded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">24. I think the only thing better than a dad joke is a mom joke.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Slow clap for this one, seriously.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">25. Grandpa forgot he had another grandson :(</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>"False alarm" is a really good way to wrap up this honestly inspired thread.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">26. I would share this too if I had a copy machine.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Oof.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaHFnYG18dHyOamqNpXqtfKOtwbJkm6eforKzecyepJ6r</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenya-extradition-court-adjourns-nnamdi-kanu-suit-against-fg-indefinitely.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Court Adjourns Nnamdi Kanu Suit Against FG Indefinitely</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chanel-ayan-son.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Chanel Ayan's Son?
