To prepare for the role, Christine did not speak with those who had suffered a stroke, but instead already had first-hand knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress' husband Bill Moloney suffered an acoustic neuroma 30 years ago, just two years after the couple got married.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a tumor in the inner ear pressing against the brain,” she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post </a>in 2019. “He had a seven-hour surgery and his whole left side became kind-of paralyzed. He was a drummer and that really ended his career. He had to learn how to walk all over again. He couldn’t blink his eye. He couldn’t smile. He still has a lot of facial pain because of nerve damage."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>She continued, “It was all on his left side.

So, the premise of the series is immigrants make America great," he told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> E! News</a>.</p><p>He added, "That was a story I felt worth telling. Yes, there is a romance here that will take a long time to play out. We're in no hurry to do that part. The story here [is] people come to this country and work their asses off to make a life for themselves and their family. That's a story worth telling."&nbsp;</p><p>Bob Hearts Abishola airs Mondays at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecOoq62hlWK8r3nBqJlmoJWWv7W%2FjJqZoquYpLmiedGemKWkqWK1osLEZphmq6SnvKyx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./god-is-with-obaseki-he-cant-be-ousted-primate-ayodele.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>God Is With Obaseki, He Can't Be Ousted</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./425416-aliyekuwa-muigizaji-katika-kipindi-cha-gumbaru-school-mzee-mathiokore-ameaga-dunia-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aliyekuwa Muigizaji Katika Kipindi cha Gumbaru School Mzee Mathiokore Ameaga Dunia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
