And we have left stakeholders who have reservations about her nomination to approach the committee.”</p><p>Giving insights into the nomination game in the Senate, a ranking senator said the Senate is under pressure to clear Onochie.</p><p>”Many people and some governors have been reaching out to APC and PDP Senators to clear her.</p><p>“For some of us, they have reached out to our leaders to prevail on us to accept her nomination,“ a source said.</p><p>The source added: “What some of us are saying, including some APC senators, is that we should take cognizance of Section 14(2a) of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution( as amended). We do not want to set bad a precedent.”</p><p>The section says: “A member of the commission shall be non-partisan and a person of unquestionable integrity.”</p><p>The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media, Sen. Ajibola Basiru said the plenary will determine Onochie’s and other nominees’ fate.</p><p>“Onochie’s nomination has been referred to the Senate Committee on INEC to consider her suitability or otherwise for the job. The same template applies to all other nominees.</p><p>“The ultimate decision on Onochie is left to the plenary, based on the recommendations of the committee.</p><p>“Don’t forget that the screening committee will only act, based on the information and representation before it. Whatever it is, the plenary is in charge of final decision”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5BuZqKmlZh6o8HHmqmiZaKas7a%2FxKxkraddp7KxuMCcnGannqSwqbXEZpisZZykr6PFjK2mZpufo7Oqvsxmn56qXZi8r8DIp6yeq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./perth-australia-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities Born In Perth, Australia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sofia-black-delia-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Star of 'Single Drunk Female' Is Very Much Married</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
