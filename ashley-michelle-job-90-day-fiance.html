Like what Ashley's job is exactly, and what it means to be a modern witch and expert in all things tarot and spiritual.</p><p>Distractify spoke exclusively with Ashley about her unconventional career and she even shared details about what's next for her in her weight loss journey.</p><p>Ashley is open about her career as a tarot card reader and astrologer. In 2019, she launched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StarSeedShadows</a>, a company that Ashley shared is dedicated to helping "witches, mystics, and healers develop their gifts."</p><p>She also offers one-on-one soul sessions and she explained to us what clients can expect from those sessions while working closely with her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ashleymichelle_90day</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ashley's job outside of '90 Day Fiancé' involves spiritualism and healing.</h2><p>Although Ashley might be getting more business than ever thanks to her exposure in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise, she started her company in 2019. Since then, she has built it into something that enables her to work with other witches, mystic healers, and clients who want to learn more about themselves through private sessions with her.</p><p>"My one-on-ones are a transformational, intimate experience unlike anything else you've had," Ashley shared with Distractify. "I sit in gratitude every day that I have been able to be a guide for hundreds of people at this point."</p><p>The Soul Sessions each include a personalized tarot reading, spiritual guidance on questions about life, and details on planetary movements to help guide clients in their personal lives.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐀𝐬𝐡𝐥𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐞👽 𝒯𝒶𝓇𝑜𝓉✨𝒜𝓈𝓉𝓇𝑜𝓁𝑜𝑔𝓎✨𝒜𝓀𝒶𝓈𝒽𝒾𝒸 𝑅𝑒𝒸𝑜𝓇𝒹𝓈✨𝒮𝒽𝒶𝒹𝑜𝓌 𝒲𝑜𝓇𝓀 (@ashleymichelle_90day)</a></p></figure><p>However, Ashley also knows that there are plenty of misconceptions about what she does. Even when her husband Manuel learned about what she does for a living on the show, he was unsure of what to make of it. But, Ashley explained to us, she "operates out of love because love begets more love."</p><p>Although one of the biggest misconceptions about her work is that she is a "devil worshipper," Ashley's goal is to help others live their fullest lives.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ashley has also shared her weight loss journey with fans outside of '90 Day Fiancé.'</h2><p>Outside of Ashley's job that keeps her plenty busy already, she recently entered the bodybuilding world. Viewers learned about Ashley losing weight during the 90 Day Fiancé Season 10 reunion. She shared with Distractify that in the same vein of pushing her body to see what it can do and because she is a "try anything once sort of girl," she plans to enter a bodybuilding competition.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ashleymichelle_90day</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ashley thinks sharing her relationship on '90 Day Fiancé' actually helped during the intense beginning.</h2><p>When we asked what it was like for Ashley and Manuel to share the hard moments at the beginning of their relationship on 90 Day Fiancé, Ashley shared that she believes being on the show has been "therapeutic at times" for them as a couple. And in some ways, it even brought them closer together.</p><p>"Of course, it's hard sometimes, because no one wants their whole relationship business on such a public platform," Ashley said. "But you can choose to learn from it and grow together as a couple if that is what you both want."</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCpuMSyZKahk52yrbjEZqGoml1ufW6wwLJkn6GRo7Cm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./473550-we-regret-voting-buhari-yoruba-elders-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Buhari's Presidency: Yoruba Elders Express Regrets</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-was-only-murders-in-the-building-filmed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Only Murders in the Building' Season 2 Is Here, but Where Was It Filmed?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
