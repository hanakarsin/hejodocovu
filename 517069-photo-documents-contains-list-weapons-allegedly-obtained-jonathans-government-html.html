The NT reports, with reference to its military source that some of the purchased items were computerised and manned with cameras&nbsp;capable of detecting enemy location from long distance. This was to ensure&nbsp;more effective fight against&nbsp;the terrorists.</p><p>See the document, believed to be official, below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt4ala6ie3c32.jpeg><p>The source was quoted as saying:</p><p><i>"You know that the Nigerian military fought a tough battle to reclaim all those local government areas numbering 22 in the states under emergency rule.&nbsp;The federal government needed weapons to equip the military to carry out that difficult task. Remember, this was also the period when the western powers were blocking the country from getting the required arms and ammunition.</i></p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Buhari: Where Are The Arms Bought By GEJ To Fight Boko Haram?</p><p><i>"Things got so bad that a vessel carrying military hardware for Nigeria was blocked in Singapore. So the government had to look towards the Eastern bloc to get arms.&nbsp;</i><i>You should also know that a good number of the arms were airlifted to the country.</i></p><p><i>"It would interest you to note that a lot of military equipment were delivered to the Nigerian Army on January 27, 2014.&nbsp;</i><i>These weapons were used effectively on the military operations that led to the recovery of the erstwhile territory under the control of the Boko Haram.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyteaq3d3f7nsc.jpeg><p><i>"The T72 tanks and the RM 70 were very dangerous weapons considered to be game changers in the various battles.</i></p><p><i>"The troops could not move without them because of the features they had and their capacity. The T72 was not only computerized but had the capacity to detect enemies."</i></p><p>However, some of&nbsp;the items which had been&nbsp;imported from Israel were delayed, while Boko Haram intensified its attacks in the northeast, the source said. Based on the NT investigation, the purchased equipment is now scheduled to arrive by the end of August, 2015.</p><p>It should be recalled that speaking recently with PR Nigeria, Dasuki said that some of the weapons "would arrive the country soon". He blasted the suppliers over frustrating the military effort by delaying delivery.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnKDj29wZqiYpMGwecOomq6llaPBtHnCqKWtmZmjwG64yKyrZq%2BVlr2wutJmmKWklZyypbjYZqabrJGeu6awjKOmp5mkna6vv4ygpq%2BdoqO6prrTZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./afcon-west-ham-rb-leipzig-scout-storm-cote-divoire-for-super-eagles-star.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>West Ham, RB Leipzig Scout Storm Cote d'Ivoire For Super Eagles Star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./five-atrocities-levelled-against-dcp-abba-kyari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Five Atrocities Levelled Against DCP Abba Kyari</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
