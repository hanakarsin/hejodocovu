Having been active since 1985 and continuing to find success today, he's had a presence in just about every era of pop culture throughout his decades-long career. Whether you know him by his songs, his rap collabs, his signature catchphrase, or even just from being kicked in the face on The Eric Andre Show, it's safe to say that there are few people who haven't heard of Flavor Flav as he keeps on making appearances.</p><p>Of course, not all of the press around Flavor Flav is good press. He's had several legal issues and health concerns over the years that include illegal substance possession, addiction, domestic violence, and driving while under the influence.</p><p>In a similar fashion, his love life has had plenty of crests and falls with fans wondering if he's ever been married or currently has a wife. Details behind his marital status are surprisingly murky, but here's what we know for sure about Flavor Flav's marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Flavor Flav actually married? Last anyone heard, he's engaged.</h2><p>Based on what's been made public so far, Flavor Flav has been engaged to Elizabeth "Liz" Trujillo since 2008. Liz appeared on <a href=#>Flavor of Love</a>, a short-lived reality dating game show that lasted for only three seasons. Liz was on the final season of the show, but according to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit post</a>, he'd been with her during the time of filming a show in which he was trying to find a fiancée. At the time, Liz was already the mother of Flav's seventh child.</p><p>Yet despite the televised proposal, no details of an eventual wedding or marriage have ever been made public in the years that followed. Many outlets claim that he's currently married and that they had a private ceremony together, though no evidence of that has been revealed. What's more, they've previously hit rough patches on their relationship. The two of them even appeared on the VH1 series <a href=#>Couples Therapy</a>, in which they and several other celebrity couples sought romantic counseling.</p><p>In what seems to be the most substantial evidence of their marriage to date, Flavor Flav did claim that he and Liz are still together as of 2016. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> made to VH1, Flav claimed that they had been together for 12 years. The article also refers to Liz as Flav's wife. As of this writing, that's about all we know about his current marital status.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>That said, he's had plenty of history with past girlfriends. He <a href=#>has eight children</a> with at least four different women and has also dated several other women. In 1993, he was arrested for domestic violence. He would face similar charges in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012</a> when he was arrested for domestic battery following an argument with Liz over his having cheated on her.</p><p>Though at least one credible source claims that Flavor Flav is married as of 2016, his current romantic status is pretty unclear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7miws6rZJ%2Bkkat6uLXFng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-bandits-gun-down-13-police-officers-in-zamfara.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bandits Gun Down 13 Police Officers In Zamfara</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1082456-federal-government-204-people-killed-southern-kaduna-crisis-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Federal government say 204 people killed in Southern Kaduna crisis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
