She’s branched out and tried several career paths. Ruby is multi-talented and blows audiences away with her performances.</p><p>She's taken home several noteworthy awards in her day. For example, we won’t soon forget that she won GQ Australia’s Woman of the Year award in 2015! Here’s what you should know about her current net worth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What’s Ruby Rose‘s net worth?</h2><p>After trying out so many different avenues over the years, Ruby Rose has created a net worth of $2 million for herself, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The contributing factors include her many roles as an actress, model, television personality, musical artist, DJ, and social media influencer.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Ruby Rose</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Model, Actress, DJ, TV Host</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $2 million</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>March 20, 1986</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Ruby Rose Langenheim</p><p><strong>Father:</strong> unknown</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Katia Langenheim</p><p><strong>Marriages:</strong> none</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> none</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> University High School and Footscray City College</p><p>When it comes to her acting résumé, she landed roles in projects like The Meg, Pitch Perfect 3, John Wick: Chapter 2, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, and <a href=#>Orange Is the New Black</a>. After accomplishing all that, she was able to land the titular role in the DC series <a href=#>Batwoman</a> before stepping down and letting <a href=#>Javicia Leslie</a> take over as the leading heroine.</p><p>She accomplished a lot as an actress, even though she chose to leave her Arrowverse show behind.</p><p>As a model, she was the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. That was one of the biggest contracts she signed. She's also taken part in several fashion collaborations that have no doubt contributed to her net worth.</p><p>She collaborated with Milk and Honey for a fashion line that includes various T-shirts, leather jackets, and washed jeans. Ruby didn’t just stop with clothing though. She also ventured out into shoe collections when she collaborated with a footwear brand called Gallaz. She really knows how to dress, and her sense of style is one plenty of people wish to emulate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 2012, Ruby released the song “Guilty Pleasure" featuring Gary Go as her first-ever single.
