And now we see the depth of the relationship is so profound that Dan’s willing to go to Louise’s to take care of her -- even if it means endangering himself.”</p><p>That being said, Dave also said it's only part of a "much bigger arc" for the pair.</p><p>One of their continuous sticking points has been Louise's insistence at having her independence, despite Dan's continued attempts to get her to commit.</p><p>"The best thing I can say is I think it's the Conners.
