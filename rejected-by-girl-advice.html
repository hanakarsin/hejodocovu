Amongst the two teachers and eight students killed was a girl named Shana Fisher. In an interview, Fisher's mother alleged that the shooter, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, had been harassing her daughter for months.</p><p>She said that Fisher had rejected him many times, but he kept asking her out. In her mother's words, Fisher "embarrassed" him in class and within a week, he had killed her and others in the school, with the alleged intention of doing more. Pagourtzis also brought explosive devices that malfunctioned on site. He is currently in police custody.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEW: The Santa Fe High School gunman killed a classmate, Shana Fisher, who had turned down his advances, her mother tells us. Shana finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and "a week later he opens fire on everyone he didn't like." <a href=#>https://t.co/clHL0gO6zP</a></p>â€” Matt Pearce ðŸ¦… (@mattdpearce) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shana Fisher "had 4 months of problems from this boy," her mother, Sadie Rodriguez, wrote in a private message to the Los Angeles Times on Facebook. "He kept making advances on her and she repeatedly told him no." <a href=#>https://t.co/clHL0gO6zP</a></p>â€” Matt Pearce ðŸ¦… (@mattdpearce) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>There are many conversations being had about gun control and school safety. GOP legislators are of course arguing for pretty much everything except making guns less accessibleâ€”for instance, the state governor is suggesting schools should have fewer doors, and that would keep kids safe. Unless there's a fire.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says there are too many entrances and exits to schools, and that is why shootings are able to happen. "Had there been one single entrance possibly for every student, maybe he would have been stopped."</p>â€” Tom Namako (@TomNamako) <a href=#>May 18, 2018</a></figure><p>But a conversation sparked by Fisher's story is what we tell young boys about what they're owed from women.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, they're owed nothing. Absolutely zero. However, we don't teach boys that. We teach them to wear women down. Twitter user @adigoesswimming has definitely had enough of that.</p><p>Quoting the Fisher's mother, she started a thread about what she said to her nephew who got rejected by a girl he liked.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My teenage nephew told me he asked a girl out and she turned him down. I said, "You know what to do now, right?" He said, "I know I know keep trying" and I said "NO. LEAVE HER ALONE. She gave you an answer." He was shocked. NO ONE had told him that before. TEACH. YOUR. BOYS. <a href=#>https://t.co/yrxjNRnfk5</a></p>â€” ðŸŒ¹ Witch, Hunting ðŸ’€ (@adigoesswimming) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>According to @adigoesswimming, no one had ever told her nephew that when a girl says she isn't interested, you leave her alone. You do not keep asking over and over until she concedes.</p><p>Admirably, @adigoesswimming is trying to respond to the many people attracted to her tweet. It's a bit of a hot button issue.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Keep trying: work on yourself and find a girl who does like him. If first girl changes her mind, she'll let him know.</p>â€” Leslietfj (@leslietfj) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's a great kid and the right person will see that.

What a gift. And we should all downplay high school crushes, which leave such an imprint but are the product of very unformed ideas about character, romance, love, and life's possibilities as well as brains that aren't done growing.</p>â€” L J Platt (@ljordanplatt) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't know that downplaying them is the answer. They feel so intense and heartbreaking and kids' feelings should be respected. But unrequited love is part of life and it can be a lesson in self-care while respecting others.</p>â€” ðŸŒ¹ Witch, Hunting ðŸ’€ (@adigoesswimming) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>In her opinion, learning to deal with being rejected is part of growing up, and a lot of people are not learning this as kids.</p><p>There is also a long connection between domestic violence and mass shooters. It's often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cited as a sign</a> that there is worse to come, but women are often not given the support they need in domestic violence situations or heard when they warn police.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This isn't the first school shooting because of an ex or spurned advances....

More women in charge.</p>â€” ðŸŒ¹ Witch, Hunting ðŸ’€ (@adigoesswimming) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>And some people think that kids should figure it out on their own:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't know though, the thought of adults telling teenagers how to approach each other makes me uncomfortable.
