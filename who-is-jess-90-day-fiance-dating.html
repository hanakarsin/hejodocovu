But then his relationship with <a href=#><u>Jess Caroline</u></a> also ended badly and, even though she‚Äôs not a longtime cast member like Colt, viewers have rooted for Jess‚Äôs own happy ending. And now, it seems, she is going to get one, as she's dating a new man.</p><p>Despite Colt failing to be the guy Jess thought he was and despite his harsh words for her during the multi-part 90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After? tell-all, Jess is happy now, possibly more than she ever was with Colt. Everyone can thank the reality TV gods that Colt never got to properly propose to her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Jess from '90 Day Fianc√©' dating?</h2><p>Jess made a Valentine‚Äôs Day post in 2020 on Facebook of herself and her then-mystery man, who fans now know as her boyfriend, Brian Harvey. Then, in May, he shared a selfie with Jess on his Instagram and they were, as the kids say, Instagram official. Brian is from Las Vegas, like Jess‚Äôs new BFF Larissa, and he‚Äôs a singer and producer. He also knew Larissa and her boyfriend Eric Nichols before he and Jess became a thing.</p><p>They starred in a music video for one of his songs and, very likely, Larissa and Eric are to thank for Brian and Jess meeting. Judging by many of Jess‚Äôs other Instagram posts after sharing a photo of herself with Brian, she is still in Las Vegas and might not have any concrete plans to leave any time soon. Of course there‚Äôs the off chance of running into her ex, Colt, but Jess seems totally unbothered by him these days and it's a good look for her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy Brazilian Valentine‚Äôs Day babe!üíú I just learned today is ‚ÄúDia Dos Namorados‚Äù in Brazil.üå∑ #diadosnamorados #amor #happy</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Brian Hanvey | Singer/Producer</a> (@brianhanvey) on Jun 12, 2020 at 9:39am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jess's boyfriend after '90 Day Fianc√©' might be more.</h2><p>Although the idea of Jess dating someone else after Colt might be news to some, there‚Äôs a chance she could be doing more than just dating Brian. By the time the tell-all was filmed, which was likely in July or August, Jess had already been dating Brian for a while. Soap Dirt obtained what appears to be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>marriage license</u></a> and credited a source close to the couple for letting the news slip that Jess and Brian were married in August 2020.</p><p>Because Jess and Brian haven‚Äôt yet confirmed this themselves, there‚Äôs no solid confirmation of Jess now being married. But if she did marry Brian after finally dumping Colt, it would be a fitting and fair ending to her arc on a disastrous season of 90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?. It might also give her reason to appear on another season later on down the line, since fans are rooting for her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@jesscaroline_ Feminism is not about making women stronger.

She got both and right now, it looks like <a href=#><u>Larissa and Eric are still together</u></a>. In fact, they recently made the move from Las Vegas to Colorado and seem to be doing great as a couple.</p><p>They could have a few more bumps in the road ahead of them, but if that happens, viewers will likely hear about it in another season.
