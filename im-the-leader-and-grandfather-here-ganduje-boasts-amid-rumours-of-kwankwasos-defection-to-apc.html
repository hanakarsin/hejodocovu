Not in local government, not in state, not in zones, but national as a whole.</p><p>“If you are an APC membership card holder, you are a subordinate and follower of the national leader. The same thing happened to leaders at ward, state and zonal levels.</p><p>“If you defect to APC today, you are our subordinate and follower. It is important for you to note this; a child of the household and a stranger are all under the care of the head of the house,”&nbsp;Daily Trust quoted the former Governor of Kano State saying.</p><p>Ganduje addressed the vast number of APC supporters in Kano, urging them to remain calm and not be apprehensive about the prospect of someone joining their party.</p><p>He added, “Don’t be afraid if someone comes to your house to get one thing or the other. For you to go to his house looking for anything and for him to come to your house, which one do you prefer?</p><p>“One who has what to offer is the one who welcomes others. One that doesn’t have anything to offer is the one looking for where to enter. Lend me your ears I want to tell you a story. What is the work of the national chairman of the APC? Is it in Kano State alone? 36 states and Abuja. Wherever I go, I am the King, I am the Sheikh, I am the Modibbo, I am the Alanguburo. So, same thing here at home, we are calling on the NNPP to pack those their perishable fruits where it will be preserved in a fridge so that it will not get spoiled or rotten.</p><p>“We are calling on them to come back to APC. Is that a crime? One who has something is the one to beg, and one who has something is the one who gives, so we are begging them to measure and see that leading this country in their party is not going to be possible. So it is something to be proud of for us when we call on them.</p><p>“Like I told you people, whoever you are and your status in the party even if you are ‘Jagora’ (leader) once you come to APC then your grandfather is here.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Ganduje, who arrived in Kano on Thursday evening, has been actively interacting with party stakeholders and supporters throughout the state.</p><p>Following a meeting with stakeholders, he reached out to Kano State Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf and other individuals, inviting them to join the APC and offering a gesture of goodwill.</p><p>Nevertheless, the governor declined the invitation, citing the lack of a formal communication channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FwZqKlXam1pnnLnpidnaJirq%2BwjKCpmqaUm661tMSrZKGdopp6qK3NnayjnV2XvKK%2F06xkmqWZmXqzwcyorKurXaSzbrfWmqWkr5GovLR5w56dnpuknryvedOoZJqok2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyray-and-taresa-90-day-the-single-life-still-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Tyray and Taresa of 90 Day: The Single Life Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-richards-clothing-line.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Richards' Clothing Line Will Be Pivotal for Drama on'RHOBH'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
