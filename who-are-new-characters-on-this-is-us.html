Season 4 just introduced us to a whole bunch of strangers and fans are intrigued — meet them all!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>The Season 4 premiere of <a href=#>This Is Us</a> felt more like an episode of Game of Thrones than the NBC family drama we know and love.</p><p>The amount of critical information viewers received in the span of 50 minutes was staggering thanks to the episode, aptly titled "Strangers," being jam-packed with people we've never seen before — all of whom have a connection to the Pearson clan in one way or another.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who are the new characters in Season 4 of This Is Us? We've got a cheat sheet for you below:</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Cassidy (Jennifer Morrison)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>A military vet deeply affected by her experiences in Afghanistan. She seeks help from a support group after lashing out at her young son, but things go south when one of the meeting's attendees throws a chair through a window in a drunken rage. That person is Nicky Pearson, Jack Pearson's younger brother.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Ryan (Nick Wechsler)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Cassidy's husband, who feels alienated by his wife when she returns home from serving overseas and worries about her excessive drinking.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Matty (Noah Salsbury Lipson)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Cassidy and Ryan's 9-year-old son, who gets hit in the face by his mom while she's intoxicated which convinces her to join a veteran's support group.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Malik Hodges (Asante Blackk)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>A teenage father trying to provide for his baby girl. At a friend's barbecue, the auto body repair shop employee develops a crush on Deja, the adopted daughter of Randall and Beth Pearson.</p><p>"He’s going to play a big part in Randall’s family’s story," the show's creator, Dan Fogelman, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> shortly after the premiere aired.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Darnell Hodges (Omar Epps)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Malik's super supportive father, played by <a href=#>Omar Epps</a>, who's also crazy in love with his wife and doesn't want to see his son have to grow up too fast.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Kelly Hodges (Marsha Stephanie Blake)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Malik's mother and Darnell's wife, who keeps both her boys in line. She tells her son "to shine that beautiful light of yours onto the world today."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Jack (Blake Stadnik)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>A blind musician who finds fame after meeting the love of his life at a diner. We also see him surrounded by empty beer bottles after a night of songwriting, possibly foreshadowing an addiction to alcohol. This Jack happens to be Toby and Kate Damon's son, who was born prematurely. The actor portraying him, <a href=#>Blake Stadnik</a>, is visually impaired in real life.</p><p>"He’s exceptionally talented," Dan told EW of Blake. "It was important to us to not cast a sighted actor here. It was also very important to us that we have somebody who can hold the screen and sing, and Blake just checked a tremendous amount of boxes."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Lucy (Auden Thornton)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Jack's wife, a chef who used to waitress at the diner where they met. She reveals she's six-weeks pregnant in the Season 4 premiere.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Dave Malone (Tim Matheson)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Rebecca Pearson's father, who doesn't think Jack (as in Milo Ventimiglia's Jack) is the right fit for his daughter. "You're a good man, Jack. I can see that," the concerned dad says. "I can also see a man who is carrying things with him. And I can see a man who is far more haunted than he wants to let on."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecCrnGamlax6pLTAq5icrJWnwG67zWaroaGjYra0edSs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./qgriggs-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Quinton Griggs - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2face-idibia-first-son-celebrates-16th-birthday-in-style.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2face Idibia First Son Celebrates 16th Birthday In Style</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1397757-50-unusual-scottish-names-children-meanings-html.html>50+ unusual Scottish names for children and their meanings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bwaap-html.html>Bwaap - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./netflix-the-king-historically-accurate.html>How Historically Accurate Is Netflix's 'The King'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-mike-die-in-stranger-things.html>The Duffer Brothers Tease a Major 'Stranger Things' Death Is It [SPOILER]?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nec-meeting-apc-to-propose-midterm-elective-convention-to-elect-adamu-omisores-successors.html>APC To Propose Midterm Elective Convention To Elect Adamu, Omisore's Successors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PixBlog.
